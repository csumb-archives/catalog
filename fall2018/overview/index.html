        Since 1961, the CSU has provided an affordable, accessible, and
        high-quality education to more than 3.4 million graduates throughout
        California. While each campus is unique based on its curricular
        specialties, location, and campus culture, every CSU is distinguished
        for the quality of its educational programs. All campuses are fully
        accredited, provide a high-quality broad liberal educational program,
        and offer opportunities for students to engage in campus life through
        the Associated Students, Inc., clubs and service learning. Through
        leading-edge programs, superior teaching and extensive workforce
        training opportunities, CSU students graduate with the critical thinking

        The CSU is governed by the Board of Trustees, most of whom are appointed
        by the governor and serve with faculty and student representatives. The
        CSU Chancellor is the chief executive officer, reporting to the Board.
        The campus presidents serve as the campus-level chief executive
        officers. The Trustees, Chancellor, and Presidents develop systemwide
        educational policy. The Presidents, in consultation with the Academic
        Senate CSU and other campus stakeholder groups, render and implement
        local policy decisions.

        The individual California State Colleges were established as a system
        with a Board of Trustees and a chancellor in 1960 by the Donahoe Higher
        Education Act. In 1972, the system was designated as the California
        State University and Colleges, and in 1982 the system became the
        California State University. Today, the CSU is comprised of 23 campuses,
        including comprehensive and polytechnic universities and, since July
        1995, the California Maritime Academy, a specialized campus.

        The oldest campus&#x2014;San Jos&#xE9; State University&#x2014;was
        founded in 1857 and became the first institution of public higher
        education in California. The newest&#x2014;CSU Channel
        Islands&#x2014;opened in fall 2002, with freshmen arriving in fall 2003.

        In 1963, the Academic Senate CSU was established to act as the official
        voice of CSU faculty in systemwide matters. Also, the California State
        College Student Presidents Association&#x2014;which was later renamed
        the California State Student Association&#x2014;was founded to represent
        each campus student association on issues affecting students.

        Through its many decades of service, the CSU has continued to adapt to
        address societal changes, student needs, and workforce trends. While the
        CSU&#x2019;s core mission has always focused on providing high-quality,
        affordable bachelor&#x2019;s and master&#x2019;s degree programs, over
        time the University has added a wide range of services and programs to
        support student success &#x2013; from adding health centers and special
        programs for veterans to building student residential facilities to
        provide a comprehensive educational experience.

      <p class="css-1xdhyk6 e1wvsc6d0">
        To improve degree completion and accommodate students working full- or
        part-time, the educational paradigm was expanded to give students the
        ability to complete upper-division and graduate requirements through
        part-time, late afternoon, and evening study. The University also
        expanded its programs to include a variety of teaching and school
        service credential programs, specially designed for working
        professionals.

    <div class="css-mpbldb eykc2020">
      <p class="css-1xdhyk6 e1wvsc6d0">
        The CSU marked another significant educational milestone when it
        broadened its degree offerings to include doctoral degrees. The CSU
        independently offers Doctor of Education (Ed.D.), Doctor of Physical
        Therapy (DPT), Doctor of Audiology (AuD), and Doctor of Nursing Practice
        (DNP) degree programs. A limited number of other doctoral degrees are
        offered jointly with the University of California and private
        institutions in California.

    <div class="css-mpbldb eykc2020">
      <p class="css-1xdhyk6 e1wvsc6d0">
        In 2010, in an effort to accommodate community college transfer
        students, the CSU, in concert with the California Community Colleges
        (CCC), launched the Associate Degree for Transfer (ADT), which
        guarantees CCC transfer students with an ADT admission to the CSU with
        junior status.

    <div class="css-mpbldb eykc2020">
      <p class="css-1xdhyk6 e1wvsc6d0">
        Always adapting to changes in technology and societal trends to support
        student learning and degree completion, the CSU achieved another
        milestone in 2013, when it launched Cal State Online, a systemwide
        collection of services that support the delivery of fully online
        programs from campuses. Now, full-time students have access to fully
        online courses offered at other CSU campuses.

        By providing an accessible, hands-on education that prepares graduates
        for career success, the CSU has created a network of alumni that is so
        extensive and renowned that it spans across the globe. As of 2016-17,
        more than 3.4 million alumni are making a difference in the lives of the
        people of California and the world.

        The CSU strives to continually develop innovative programs, services,
        and opportunities that will give students the tools they need to meet
        their full potential. In 2016, the university launched Graduation
        Initiative 2025, a bold plan to support students, increase the number of
        California&apos;s graduates earning high-quality degrees and eliminate
        achievement and equity gaps for all students. Through this initiative,
        the CSU is ensuring that all students have the opportunity to graduate
        according to their personal goals, positively impacting their lives,
        families, and communities. The CSU is committed to providing a quality
        higher education that prepares students to become leaders in the
        changing workforce.
