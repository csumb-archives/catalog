          The federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (20
          U.S.C. 1232g) and regulations adopted there under (34 C.F.R. 99) set
          out requirements designed to protect students&apos; privacy in their
          records maintained by the campus. The statute and regulations govern
          access to certain student records maintained by the campus and the
          release of such records. The law provides that the campus must give
          students access to most records directly related to the student, and
          must also provide opportunity for a hearing to challenge the records
          if the student claims they are inaccurate, misleading or otherwise
          inappropriate. The right to a hearing under this law does not include
          any right to challenge the appropriateness of a grade determined by
          the instructor. The law generally requires the institution to receive
          a student&apos;s written consent before releasing personally
          identifiable data about the student.

          The federal Military Selective Service Act (the &quot;Act&quot;)
          requires most males residing in the United States to present
          themselves for registration with the Selective Service System within
          thirty days of their eighteenth birthday. Most males between the ages
          of 18 and 25 must be registered. Males born after December 31, 1959,
          may be required to submit a statement of compliance with the Act and
          regulations in order to receive any grant, loan, or work assistance
          under specified provisions of existing federal law. In California,

          <strong>Sexual Misconduct </strong> All sexual activity between
          members of the University community must be based on affirmative
          consent. Engaging in any sexual activity without first obtaining
          affirmative consent to the specific activity is sexual misconduct,
          whether or not the conduct violates any civil or criminal law. Sexual
          activity includes, but is not limited to, kissing,touching intimate
          body parts, fondling, intercourse, penetration of any body part, and
          oral sex. It also includes any unwelcome physical acts, such as
          unwelcome sexual touching, sexual assault, sexual battery, rape, and
          dating violence. When based on gender, domestic violence or stalking
          also constitutes sexual misconduct. Sexual misconduct may include
          using physical force,violence, threat or intimidation, ignoring the
          objections of the other person, causing the other person&#x2019;s
          intoxication or incapacitation through the use of drugs or alcohol, or
          taking advantage of the other person&#x2019;s incapacitation
          (including voluntary intoxication) to engage in sexual activity. Men
          as well as women can be victims of these forms of sexual misconduct.
          Sexual activity with a minor is never consensual when the complainant
          is under 18 years old, because the minor is considered incapable of
          giving legal consent due to age.

          threats of future retaliation and duress. Any sexual penetration,
          however slight, is sufficient to constitute rape. Sexual acts

          <strong>Affirmative consent</strong> means an informed, affirmative,
          conscious, voluntary, and mutual agreement to engage in sexual
          activity. It is the responsibility of each person involved in the
          sexual activity to ensure that s/he has the affirmative consent of the
          other participant(s) to engage in the sexual activity. Lack of a
          protest or resistance does not mean consent nor does silence mean
          consent. Affirmative consent must be voluntary, and given without
          coercion, force, threats, or intimidation.

            The existence of a dating or social relationship between those
            involved, or the fact of past sexual activities between them, should
            never by itself be assumed to be an indicator of affirmative
            consent. A request for someone to use a condom or birth control does
            not, in and of itself, constitute affirmative consent.
          </li>
          <li>
            Affirmative consent can be withdrawn or revoked. Consent to one form
            of sexual activity (or sexual act) does not constitute consent to
            other forms of sexual activity. Consent given to sexual activity on
            one occasion does not constitute consent on another occasion. There
            must always be mutual and affirmative consent to engage in sexual
            activity. Consent must be ongoing throughout a sexual activity and
            can be revoked at any time, including after penetration. Once
            consent is withdrawn or revoked, the sexual activity must stop
            immediately.
          </li>
          <li>
            A person who is incapacitated cannot give affirmative consent. A
            person is unable to consent when s/he is asleep, unconscious or is
            incapacitated due to the influence of drugs, alcohol,or medication
            so that s/he could not understand the fact, nature or extent of the
            sexual activity. A person is incapacitated if s/he lacks the
            physical and/or mental ability to make informed, rational decisions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Whether an intoxicated person (as a result of using alcohol or other
            drugs) is incapacitated depends on the extent to which the alcohol
            or other drugs impact the person&#x2019;s decision- making capacity,
            awareness of consequences, and ability to make fully informed
            judgments. A person&#x2019;s own intoxication or incapacitation from
            drugs or alcohol does not diminish that person&#x2019;s
            responsibility to obtain affirmative consent before engaging in
            sexual activity.
          </li>
          <li>
            A person with a medical or mental disability may also lack the
            capacity to give consent.

            Sexual activity with a minor (a person under 18 years old) is not

            activity under any of the following circumstances:

          provide victims with that assistance if requested by the victim. These

          If a victim reports to local or University Police about sexual
          misconduct crimes, the police are required to notify victims that
          their names will become a matter of public record unless

          identity be kept confidential, his/her name will not become a matter
          of public record and the police will not report the victim&#x2019;s
          identity to anyone else at the University, including the Title IX
          Coordinator. University Police will, however, report the facts of the
          incident itself to the Title IX Coordinator being sure not to reveal
          to the Title IX Coordinator victim names/identities or compromise
          their own criminal investigation. The University is required by the
          federal Clery Act to report certain types of crimes (including certain
          sex offenses) in statistical reports. However, while the University
          will report the type of incident in the annual crime statistics report
          known as the Annual Security Report, victim names/identities will not
          be revealed.

          Reporting to the Title IX Coordinator and Other University Employees

          Most University employees have a duty to report incidents of sexual
          misconduct when they are on notice of it. When a victim tells the
          Title IX Coordinator or another University employee about an incident
          of sexual misconduct, the victim has the right to expect the
          University to take immediate and appropriate steps to investigate what
          happened and to resolve the matter promptly and equitably. In all
          cases, the University strongly encourages victims to report incidents
          of sexual misconduct directly to the campus Title IX Coordinator. As
          detailed above, in the &#x201C;Privileged and Confidential
          Communications&#x201D; section of this policy, all University
          employees except physicians, licensed professional counselors,
          licensed clinical social workers, sexual assault counselors and
          advocates, must report to the Title IX Coordinator all relevant
          details about any incidents of sexual misconduct of which they become
          aware. The University will need to determine what happened &#x2013;
          and will need to know the names of the victim(s) and the
          perpetrator(s), any witnesses, and any other relevant facts, including
          the date, time, and specific location of the incident.

        <p class="css-1xdhyk6 e1wvsc6d0">
          To the extent possible, information reported to the Title IX
          Coordinator or other University employees will be shared only with
          individuals responsible for handling the University&#x2019;s response
          to the incident. The University will protect the privacy of
          individuals involved in a sexual misconduct incident except as
          otherwise required by law or University policy. A report of sexual
          misconduct may result in the gathering of extremely sensitive
          information about individuals in the campus community. While such
          information is considered confidential, University policy regarding
          access to public records and disclosure of personal information may
          require disclosure of certain information concerning a report of
          sexual misconduct. In such cases, efforts will be made to redact the
          records, as appropriate, in order to protect the victim&#x2019;s
          identity and privacy and the privacy of other involved individuals.
          Except as detailed in the section on Privileged and Confidential
          Communications above, no University employee, including the Title IX
          Coordinator, should disclose the victim&#x2019;s identity to the
          police without the victim&#x2019;s consent or unless the victim has
          also reported the incident to the police.

          If a victim requests of the Title IX Coordinator or another University
          employee that his/her identity remain completely confidential, the
          Title IX Coordinator will explain that the University cannot always
          honor that request or guarantee complete confidentiality. If a victim
          wishes to remain confidential or request that no investigation be
          conducted or disciplinary action taken, the University must weigh that
          request against the University&#x2019;s obligation to provide a safe,
          non-discriminatory environment for all students,employees, and third
          parties, including the victim. Under those circumstances,the Title IX
          Coordinator will determine whether the victim&#x2019;s request for
          complete confidentiality and/or no investigation can be honored under
          the facts and circumstances of the particular case, including whether
          the University has a legal obligation to report the incident, conduct
          an investigation or take other appropriate steps. Without information
          about a victim&#x2019;s identity, the University&#x2019;s ability to
          meaningfully investigate the incident and pursue disciplinary action
          against the perpetrator may be severely limited. See Executive Order
          1095 (or any successor executive order) for further details around
          confidential reporting, and other related matters
          (http://www.calstate.edu/eo/EO-1095-rev-6-23-15.pdf).

          CSUMB will not tolerate sexual assault in any form. CSUMB has adopted
          the state of California&apos;s definition of sexual assault to mean
          any involuntary sexual act in which a person is threatened, coerced,
          or forced to comply against his or her will and includes rape,
          acquaintance rape, date rape, and sexual battery. Sexual assault,
          which is a form of sexual harassment, is included in the definition of
          sex discrimination which is prohibited in Title VII of the Civil
          Rights Act of 1964 as amended and Title IX of the Educational
          Amendments of 1972 as amended. It is also governed by the California
          Penal Code (Sections 261 and 243.4) and Assembly Concurrent Resolution
          No. 46 (Resolution Chapter 105, passed into law on September 14,
          1987).

          Report sexual assault on campus to the University Police Department
          (UPD) immediately at 911 from any campus phone. Sexual assault is a
          form of sexual harassment and is also a violation of the criminal
          code. Thus, an individual reporting an allegation of sexual assault
          may initiate a criminal complaint, a discrimination complaint, or
          both, as the evidentiary standards and conclusions may differ. To file
          a criminal complaint, the reporting party should contact UPD at 911
          (during the emergency) or 831-655-0268. To file a complaint of
          discrimination with the University as a student, the reporting party
          should contact the Deputy Title IX Coordinator at 831-582-3510.

          business dealings with the university, his or her employment,
          compensation or work assignments or, in the case of students, grades,
          class selection or other matters pertaining to his or her status as a

          Sanctions for the conduct listed above can be imposed on applicants,
          enrolled students, students between academic terms, graduates awaiting
          degrees, and students who withdraw from school while a disciplinary
          matter is pending. Conduct that threatens the safety or security of
          the campus community, or substantially disrupts the functions or
          operation of the university is within the jurisdiction of this article
          regardless of whether it occurs on or off campus. Nothing in this code
          may conflict with Education Code section 66301 that prohibits
          disciplinary action against students based on behavior protected by
          the First Amendment.
