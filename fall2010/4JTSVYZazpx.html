    <span class="print-link"></span> <p>Grants are based on financial need and do not have to be repaid. If you withdraw from the university during a term, you may have to repay a portion of your financial aid award.</p>
<h5>Federal Pell Grant</h5>
<p>The Federal Pell Grant is available to students pursuing their first undergraduate degree, and to students enrolled at CSUMB in a teacher credential program. Award amounts range from $976 to $5,350 and are prorated for students enrolled less than full-time.</p>
<h5>Academic Competitiveness Grant (ACG)</h5>
<p>The ACG grant is for first and second year students who have recently graduated high school and completed a rigorous secondary program of study. Other criteria must be met to receive this award.</p>
<h5>SMART Grant</h5>
<p>The SMART grant is for third and fourth year students in the designated majors of Environmental Science, Technology &amp; Policy, Math, Computer Science &amp; Information Technology, and Information Technology &amp; Communication Design. You must have and maintain a 3.0 GPA to qualify.</p>
<h5>Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant</h5>
<p>The FSEOG is for undergraduate students who have exceptional financial need, are pursuing their first degree, and demonstrate eligibility for the Federal Pell Grant. The amount of FSEOG at CSUMB ranges from $100 to $400.</p>
<h5>TEACH Grant</h5>
<p>Through the College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007, Congress created the Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant Program that provides grants of up to $4,000 per year to students who intend to teach in a public or private elementary or secondary school that serves students from low-income families.</p>
<h5>Educational Opportunity Program Grant</h5>
<p>The EOP grant is available to undergraduate students admitted to CSUMB through EOP. Due to limited state funds, not all EOP students receive EOP grants.</p>
<h5>Cal Grants A, B, T</h5>
<p>The State of California provides grants to undergraduate and teacher credential candidates who are California residents for payment of registration fees. Initial awards are based on financial need, grade point average and year in school. Renewal awards are based on financial need and satisfactory academic progress.</p>
<p><strong>Cal Grant A</strong> initial awards are available to undergraduate students with both need and academic merit. This award pays state fees. Grants are renewable through the fourth year of college, and for the teacher credential program.</p>
<p><strong>Cal Grant B</strong> initial awards provide a stipend of $1,551 for first bachelor&apos;s degree students demonstrating high financial need and academic merit. Renewal Cal B awards include both a fee payment and the stipend.</p>
<p><strong>Cal Grant T</strong> awards are provided to students who will enter the Teacher Credential Program in Fall 2009. The maximum award for this grant is $2,256 and it is not renewable. Students with renewable Cal A or B awards are not eligible for Cal T. *Due to the State budget, Cal Grant T will not be awarded for 2009-2010.</p>
<p>As a condition of receiving a Cal Grant T award, a recipient must teach for one year at a low-performing school for each $2,000 of award received, for a maximum of four years. Recipients who do not meet the teaching obligation must repay the award.</p>
<p>Recipients of California State Grants are notified in writing by the California Student Aid Commission (CSAC) in early summer.</p>
<h5>State University Grant</h5>
<p>State University Grants (SUG) are intended for students who are residents of California. Priority is given to students who have an EFC of 800 or less. Students receiving a fee payment from other programs, such as Vocational Rehabilitation,&#xA0; Over 60s, and Cal Grant A, B (access) are not eligible to receive this grant.</p>
<h5>CSUMB Residential Life Grant<br></h5>
<p>CSUMB&apos;s residential life grant provides assistance to students living on campus in the residence halls and the North Quad suites or apartments. Recipients must demonstrate high financial need and a minimum GPA of 2.5 or above. Due to limited funding, not all qualified students receive this grant, so you should file your FAFSA as soon after January 1 as possible.</p>
