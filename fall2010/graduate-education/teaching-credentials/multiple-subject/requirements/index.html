<p>Total credits: 36</p>
<p>Credits at CSUMB: 36</p>
<p>Credits in the program: 36</p>
<h5>Outcomes, Courses, and Assessment</h5>
<p>The philosophy and purposes of all educator preparation programs at CSUMB are evidenced in outcome skills, knowledge, and dispositions in our teacher candidates as they complete their programs. Our candidates demonstrate effective teaching practices in multicultural, pluralistic settings as they seek to contribute to a socially just society. Our curricula are all outcomes-based, and result in the achievement of program standards. </p>
<h6>Skill and Knowledge Outcomes</h6>
<p>All credential programs are based on the California Standards for the Teaching Professions (CSTPs). Our expectations are outcome behaviors, knowledge, and skills directly related to the effective teaching practices embodied in the standards. The CSTPs are restated here as a major portion of the outcomes of all credential programs. </p>
<p><strong>CSTP 1  Making subject matter comprehensible to students</strong></p>
<p><strong>CSTP 2  Assessing student learning</strong></p>
<p><strong>CSTP 3  Engaging and supporting students in learning</strong></p>
<p><strong>CSTP 4  Planning instruction and designing learning experiences for students</strong></p>
<p><strong>CSTP 5  Creating and maintaining effective environments for student learning</strong></p>
<p><strong>CSTP 6  Developing as a professional educator</strong></p>
<p>The following additional program learning outcome has been described for our CSUMB credential programs:</p>
<p><strong>LO 7  Planning and implementing an inclusive, multicultural, and assets-based curriculum</strong></p>
<p>You demonstrate these outcomes in course settings and during practical training experiences through measures that are integrated with the curriculum.  As our program prepares you to demonstrate successful beginning practice in teaching, you satisfy the CSTPs by successfully completing all of the courses listed, and through your preparation of a professional portfolio. You prepare products in each of your courses and compile them into your professional portfolio,  which you present at the conclusion of the program. You include reflective comments, a personal philosophy statement about teaching, and supporting documentation such as observation reports of your teaching in your portfolio as well.</p>
<h6>Dispositional Outcomes</h6>
<p>The Teacher Education Department has adopted a set of professional dispositions that are to be demonstrated by candidates as part of the requirements for program completion.  These dispositions include the following.</p>
<p><strong>Professional educators are committed to ethical conduct:  fairness, honesty, responsibility, compassion, collaboration, collegiality.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Professional educators believe all students can and will experience academic success.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Professional educators believe individual differences in learners are assets to be accommodated in the classroom.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Professional educators are inclined towards being advocates who identify and strive to eliminate inequities, social injustice, and prejudice as stewards of public education for a just society.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Professional educators reflect on their own practices in a process that leads to continual improvement.</strong></p>
<p>The means for conveying professional dispositions and evaluating their achievement include course assignments; instructional plans; applied assessments; field experiences and other practical training; observed teaching practices and other interactions with students in a classroom; and reflection assignments and self-reflection.</p>
