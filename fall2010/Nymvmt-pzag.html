    <span class="print-link"></span> <p>At this critical time in our nation&apos;s history, the Panetta Institute and CSUMB have an extraordinary opportunity to provide a master&apos;s in public policy program that will train a new generation of men and women as leaders to meet the great policy challenges that lie ahead.<br> <em>~ Hon. Leon Panetta, Director, Panetta Institute of Public Policy</em></p>
<p>We are committed to preparing you to assume positions in increasingly complex policy environments and create innovative public policies that improve government responsiveness, address issues of social justice and lead to actions optimizing the health and wellbeing of individuals, families and communities.<br> <em>~ Dr. Kim Judson, MPP Faculty</em></p>
<p>Participating in the MPP graduate program continues to be an invigorating, enlightening experience which has given me the impetus to become a more efficient, informed and knowledgeable public servant for the community. The superior quality of the professors and my fellow students has created an enriched learning environment with engaging discussions and first-class presentations. Needless to say, learning from the Honorable Leon Panetta is both a privilege and an inspiration.<br> <em>~ Janet Barnes, City Council Member, Salinas, CA , Class of 2006</em></p>
<p>Though I&apos;ve spent my career working in politics and policy arenas, I never received a comprehensive grounding in public policy. The CSUMB MPP program has provided that foundation, emphasizing substantive achievement in a collaborative setting. My peers are all accomplished community leaders, making the experience even richer, and the opportunity to study with Leon Panetta is phenomenal. I recommend the program for anyone who is passionate about creating positive change in their community.<br> <em>~ Greg Sellers, May Pro Tem &amp; Principal, Sellers/Associates, Morgan Hill, CA, Class of 2006</em></p>
<p>After completing my first year in the MPP program, I can honestly say that it is the most practical education I have ever received. As a manager in municipal government, I have new analytical skills with which to frame the issues confronting my agency and city, as well as new skills in ethical and collaborative leadership with which to address those issues. The workload is intense and challenging. The faculty fosters a collegial atmosphere where active participation is not only encouraged, but expected. I have learned as much from the diverse viewpoints of my classmates as from the coursework. I strongly recommend this program to anyone interested in acquiring practical knowledge and skills with which to affect change in the public or political sectors.<br> <em>~ Kelly J. McMillin, Lieutenant, Salinas Police Department, CA, Class of 2006</em></p>
<p>I applied to the CSUMB MPP program to learn how I might use my talents and experience to leave the world better than I found it. I discovered a setting that combines a challenging academic environment with a very practical focus. Students and teachers together provide an incredible range of life experience that offers additional insights. As a result, I learn so much that I often come home too excited to sleep. For me, it&apos;s like Disneyland, only with ideas not rides. I can hardly wait to see what happens next.<br> <em>~ Captain Martha Diehl, Monterey County Planning Commissioner, Big Sur, CA, Class of 2006</em></p>
