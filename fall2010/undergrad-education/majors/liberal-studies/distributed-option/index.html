    <span class="print-link"></span> <p>Liberal Studies Distributed Degree Completion program (LSDC) offers upper-division students an alternative to regular on-campus class sessions. The program, approved by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, allows students to complete some of their upper-division coursework in a distributed approach to learning.</p>
<p><strong>The Liberal Studies Distributed Degree Completion program (LSDC) is not currently offered.</strong></p>
<h5>What is a distributed learning?</h5>
<p>Distributed learning means that learning occurs in a variety of modes and places, responsive to the needs of the learner. Distributed learning can include face-to-face sessions as well as online activities; work on campus, in communities and on the Internet; video transmissions; and much more. Distributed learning overcomes time and distance barriers with diverse teaching and learning strategies that ensure both access and success for learners.</p>
<h5>Can I complete my degree entirely online without going to the CSUMB campus?</h5>
<p>No, not at this time. Some of our classes are completely online, while others meet on campus or at a fieldsite from one to four times during the semester for orientation, assessment, labs or special sessions. We are adapting online courses every semester, but not every course is available in the online format at this time. Depending on how quickly you progress through the degree program, a specific course may not be available online by the time you wish to take it. Our plan is to develop online courses for every Liberal Studies Major Learning Outcome, but at this stage of our program&apos;s development, some students choose to mix online courses with on-campus classes to complete their degrees. Others complete the outcomes at community colleges or take the online classes as they become available. In cooperation with other CSU campuses, some students take online courses at our sister campuses (under <a href="http://ar.csumb.edu/site/x4712.xml" rel="nofollow">Concurrent Enrollment</a>) to supplement the offerings from CSUMB.</p>
<h5>What courses does CSUMB offer online to help me achieve the Liberal Studies outcomes?</h5>

</ul>
<p>More courses are in development or planned for online delivery in the near future!</p>
<h5>Will I miss out on the learning that occurs in a traditional classroom environment?</h5>
<p>Online discussions take the place of in-class sessions. You can expect regular communication with your classmates and your instructor, collaboration with other learners, group problem solving and other interactive learning activities. Online exchange provides an advantage as it gives you time to develop your contributions and to reflect on the input of others.</p>
<h5>Is there a time demand difference between on campus courses and online learning?</h5>
<p>Online courses demand as much study time as other upper-division courses, but more overall time since face to face meetings are held rarely, if at all. The big differences are that you decide what time of day you will &quot;attend class,&quot; and you won&apos;t spend any time commuting to get there. As such, this program may work for those who live a long way from a university campus and for those trying to fit their education into a less traditional schedule that precludes coming to campus for regular classtimes. On the other hand, online learning only fits well if you are a highly motivated student with good time management skills and access to speedy technology. The courses do have set beginning and ending dates, with key outcomes required along the way to assist you in keeping on schedule and meeting your academic goals.</p>
<h5>What do I need to get into Liberal Studies Degree Completion program?</h5>
<ol>
<li>The completion of  lower-division courses (all of GE)                                                        Transfer students must have at least 60 transferable units, including at least 30 general education units that include written communication, oral communication, quantitative reasoning and critical thinking.</li>
<li>The minimum GPA of 2.00 for California residents and 2.40 for nonresidents </li>
<li>The availabilty for some scheduled meetings on campus or at fieldsites late in the afternoon or on Saturday                                                                                                    A few of our online courses may have from one to four meetings scheduled during the semester for presentations, assessments or orientation.</li>
<li>The availability of a computer with high-speed Internet access </li>
</ol>
<h5>What courses should I take to prepare for entry into the Liberal Studies Degree Completion major?</h5>
<p>In order to transfer as a junior to any CSU campus, you are required to complete, with grades of C or better, courses in written communication, oral communication, critical thinking and quantitative reasoning. In addition, it is recommended that you complete the lower-division requirements and prerequisites for the Liberal Studies major before entering the LSDC program.</p>
<h5>How much will it cost to get my Liberal Studies degree?</h5>
<p>LSDC students pay the same fees for their courses as other CSUMB students pay for on-campus courses. Please see the <em><a href="http://csumb.edu/site/x478.xml" rel="nofollow">Tuition/Fees</a></em> section of the catalog for current undergraduate fees for fulltime (more than six credits) and part-time (up to six credits) students.</p>
<p>Your total costs will depend on how many courses you take each semester and which outcomes you have already achieved through prior coursework and other learning experiences.</p>
<p>You may qualify for financial aid that will help defray your costs. To be eligible for financial aid at CSUMB, you must complete the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid). You can do this online (fafsa.ed.gov). The CSUMB Financial Aid Code for entry on your FAFSA application is 032603. (Note: After your application is submitted, the process takes approximately four to six weeks.) In addition to completing the FAFSA, you should call our financial aid office for information on local grants and scholarships. Ask about our Presidential Access Loan program if you need help acquiring a computer for this program. Also, keep in mind that some employers offer educational aid for employees and their families.</p>
<h5>How do I get started?</h5>
<p>If you need more information before applying, contact CSUMB Office of Admissions regarding pre-admission counseling, the application process, fees and financial aid.</p>
<p>If not yet enrolled at CSUMB, you can apply online (<a href="http://www.csumentor.com/" rel="nofollow">csumentor.edu</a>). Be sure to select &quot;Liberal Studies Degree Completion B.A.&quot; as your major. Submit official transcripts from all previously attended colleges along with the $55 application fee or an approved application waiver.</p>
<p>If you are a current CSUMB student, please contact the Liberal Advisor to discuss changing your major.</p>
<h5>Faculty Quotes</h5>
<p>&quot;Whether you have a demanding work schedule, family responsibilities or want to spend your time completing coursework instead of driving long distances to university classes, becoming a&#xA0; CSUMB Liberal Studies Degree Completion major can provide the flexibility you want in finishing your degree.&quot;<em> </em></p>
