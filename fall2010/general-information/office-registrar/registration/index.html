    <span class="print-link"></span> <p>CSUMB strives to make the registration experience as smooth as possible. The registration process includes <a href="../../../site/x2151.xml" rel="nofollow">fee payment</a>, academic advising and class enrollment. All academic and financial holds must be reconciled to be eligible for registration.</p>
<p><strong>Academic Advising</strong></p>
<p>To complete the academic advising process, you should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Review the <a href="http://csumb.edu/catalog" rel="nofollow">CSUMB.EDU/catalog</a> and <a href="http://csumb.edu/schedule" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CSUMB.EDU/schedule</a> websites for important information regarding CSUMB&apos;s outcomes-based curriculum, University Learning Requirements (ULRs), Major Learning Outcomes (MLOs), assessment and other key components of academic life at CSUMB.</li>
<li>Find current class offerings on the <a href="http://csumb.edu/schedule" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CSUMB.EDU/schedule</a> website; check their descriptions and prerequisites by clicking on the course title or a course description link; and cross-reference them with ULR and MLO requirements as listed on the <a href="http://csumb.edu/catalog" rel="nofollow">CSUMB.EDU/catalog</a> website.</li>
<li>Consult an Academic Advisor in the <a href="../../../services-activities/academic-support/advising/index.html" rel="nofollow">Undergraduate Advising Center</a> or contact your Faculty Advisor for more information.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Class Enrollment</strong></p>
<p>If eligible to register, you will receive a registration notification prior to the opening of the Advisement period which will inform you of the registration process and offer you several resources to aid in the enrollment process. If eligible, you may register online at <a href="http://my.csumb.edu/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MyCSUMB</a> at or after your assigned enrollment appointment time.</p>
<p><strong>Late Registration</strong></p>
<p>You can register late with approval of individual instructors through the second week of the semester. A late fee will apply. Forms are available at the Campus Service Center in the Student Services Building or on the <a href="http://ar.csumb.edu/site/x4905.xml" rel="nofollow">Office of the Registrar&#x2019;s Registration Forms</a> website.</p>
<p><strong>Adds and Drops</strong></p>
<p>The responsibility for adding and dropping any course rests solely with you. CSUMB will determine and publish the&#xA0;schedule adjustment periods available to you. These periods may vary based on the time of year a course is offered, the format in which a course is offered, or other appropriate variables.&#xA0;Schedule adjustment periods will be posted on the <a title="Registration Deadlines" href="http://ar.csumb.edu/site/x5422.xml" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Registration Deadlines</a>&#xA0;webpage.</p>
<p>You may add courses within the schedule adjustment period with the approval of the instructor. Beyond the schedule adjustment period you may petition the appropriate instructor to add a course. All courses added after the&#xA0;schedule adjustment period must be reviewed by the college dean for approval.</p>
<p>You may drop courses during the schedule adjustment period without approval of the instructor. After the schedule adjustment period, you may&#xA0;withdraw from&#xA0;courses for serious and compelling reasons using the Class Withdrawal form with the approval of the instructor and the Dean of your college.&#xA0; A grade of<em> &quot;W&quot; </em>will appear on your transcript for courses&#xA0;withdrawn from after the&#xA0;schedule adjustment&#xA0;period.</p>
<p>Instructors may give up your place in class if you do not attend or contact the instructor by the second meeting of the course. The course will not appear on your transcript when the instructor drops you for nonattendance during the schedule adjustment period.</p>
<p><strong>Cancellation of Registration or Withdrawal from the Institution</strong></p>
<p>If you find it necessary to cancel your registration or to withdraw from all classes after enrolling for any academic term, you must follow the university&apos;s official withdrawal procedures. Failure to follow formal university procedures may result in an obligation to pay fees as well as the assignment of failing grades in all courses and the need to apply for readmission before being permitted to enroll in another academic term. Information on canceling registration and withdrawal procedures is available from:</p>
<p><strong>The Office of the Registrar</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Student Services Building<br>100 Campus Center<br>Seaside, <a href="/courses/json/ca-93955.json" class="course-link">CA 93955</a>-8001</li>
<li>831-582-3085</li>
<li><a href="mailto:records@csumb.edu" rel="nofollow">records@csumb.edu</a></li>
</ul>
<p>To withdraw, you begin the process by contacting the Office of the Registrar. The date of contact determines your withdrawal initiation date. The Financial Aid Office will use this date to determine if any repayment of financial aid will be required. To formally withdraw from the institution, you must complete the withdrawal process by submitting the withdrawal form, with all required signatures and clearances, to the Office of the Registrar.</p>
<p>If you wish to withdraw from CSUMB after the schedule adjustment period, you may do so for documented serious and compelling reasons (e.g. death in the immediate family, medical complications and legal actions). A grade of <em>W</em> will appear on your transcript for all courses dropped after the schedule adjustment period.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Undergraduate students may withdraw from no more than 18 units at CSU Monterey Bay [Effective Fall 2009].</p>
<p>Withdrawals shall not be permitted during the final twenty percent of instruction except in cases, such as accident or serious illness, where the cause of the withdrawal is due to circumstances clearly beyond the student&apos;s control. Withdrawals of this sort may involve total withdrawal from the campus or may involve only one course, except that course grade and credit or an Incomplete may be assigned for courses in which sufficient work has been completed to permit an evaluation to be made.</p>
<p>If you receive financial aid funds, you must consult with the Financial Aid Office prior to withdrawing from the university regarding any required return or repayment of grant or loan assistance received for that academic term or payment period. If you are a recipient of student financial aid funds and you withdraw from the institution during an academic term or a payment period, the amount of grant or loan assistance received may be subject to return or repayment provisions.</p>
