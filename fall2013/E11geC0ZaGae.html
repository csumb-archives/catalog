    <span class="print-link"></span> <p><strong>Academic Probation</strong></p>
<p>Undergraduate students must maintain a cumulative and CSUMB grade point average of at least 2.0 and demonstrate satisfactory progress to degree consistent with university policy (<em>CSUMB Matriculation Policy, section 3.50 Academic Standing</em>).</p>
<p>An undergraduate student is placed on Academic Probation if at any time the cumulative grade point average in all college work or a cumulative grade point average at CSUMB falls below a &apos;C&apos; (2.0) average. The college dean shall notify students on Academic Probation by email. Students shall remain on Academic Probation until the cumulative and CSUMB grade point average is a &apos;C&apos; average or until the student has been Academically Disqualified.</p>
<p>Graduate students, including those who are classified or conditionally classified, and credential seeking students will be placed on academic probation if their CSUMB cumulative grade point average falls below a &apos;B&apos; (3.0) average. Some graduate programs have more rigorous standards, requiring students to maintain a&#xA0;grade point average&#xA0;of 3.0 or better in all courses. For these programs, a graduate program coordinator or college dean may notify a student of Academic Probation. Students should consult an advisor or graduate program coordinator to determine their obligation.</p>
<p><strong>Academic Disqualification</strong></p>
<p>Title 5 of the California Code of Regulations mandates the following definition and formula for Academic Disqualification:</p>
<p>Academic Disqualification means that the student has not maintained satisfactory academic standards and is involuntarily separated from the university.</p>
<p>Undergraduates on academic probation are subject to Academic Disqualification when:</p>
<ul>
<li>As a freshman (fewer than 30 semester hours of college work completed) the student falls below a grade point average of 1.50 in all units attempted or in all units attempted at the campus where enrolled.</li>
<li>As a sophomore (30-59 semester hours of college work completed) the student falls below a grade point average of 1.70 in all units attempted or in all units attempted at the campus where enrolled.</li>
<li>As a junior (60-89 semester hours of college work completed) the student falls below a grade point average of 1.85 in all units attempted or in all units attempted at the campus where enrolled.</li>
<li>As a senior (90 or more semester hours of college work completed) the student falls below a grade point average of 1.95 in all units attempted or in all units attempted at the campus where enrolled.</li>
</ul>
<p>Graduate or credential seeking students on academic probation are subject to Academic Disqualification when the student&apos;s cumulative&#xA0;grade point average&#xA0;(or in applicable programs, when the student&apos;s course grades) at CSU Monterey Bay is below a 3.0 for a second consecutive term.</p>
<p>Students who have been disqualified shall be notified by the college dean of the disqualification and of the right to petition the university for reinstatement.</p>
<p><strong>Notice of Disqualification</strong></p>
<p>If you are disqualified at the end of an enrollment period under any of these provisions you will be notified before the beginning of the next consecutive regular enrollment period. If you are disqualified at the beginning of a summer enrollment break you will be notified at least one month before the start of the fall term. In cases where you ordinarily would be disqualified at the end of a term, save for the fact that it is not possible to make timely notification, you may be advised that the disqualification is to be effective at the end of the next term. Such notification will include any conditions which, if met, would result in permission to continue in enrollment. Failure to notify students does not create the right of a student to continue enrollment.</p>
<p><strong>Administrative Academic Probation</strong></p>
<p>An undergraduate or graduate student may be placed on Administrative Academic Probation by action of appropriate campus officials for any of the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Withdrawal from all or a substantial portion of a program of studies in two successive terms or in any of three terms. Students whose withdrawal is directly associated with a chronic or recurring medical condition or its treatment are exempted.</li>
<li>Repeated failure to progress toward the stated degree objective or other program objective, including that resulting from assignment of 15 units of No Credit, when such failure appears to be due to circumstances within the control of the student.</li>
<li>Failure to comply, after due notice, with academic requirements or regulation, as defined by campus policy, which is routine for all students of a defined group of students (example: failure to complete a required practicum, failure to complete a specified number of units as a condition for receiving student financial aid or making satisfactory progress in the academic program).</li>
</ul>
<p>When such action is taken, the student shall be notified via email and writing by the appropriate CSUMB administrative office. This notification shall provide the conditions for removal from probation and the circumstances that would lead to disqualification, should probation not be removed.</p>
<p><strong>Administrative Academic Disqualification</strong></p>
<p>As authorized by section 41300 of Title 5, the president may designate a campus official to act to disqualify a student not on probation when the following circumstances exist:</p>
<ul>
<li>The conditions for removal from Administrative Academic Probation are not met within the period specified.</li>
<li>The student becomes subject to Academic Probation while on Administrative Academic Probation.</li>
<li>The student becomes subject to Administrative Academic Probation for the same or similar reason for which he/she has been placed on Administrative Academic Probation previously, although not currently in such status.</li>
<li>At the end of any term, the student has a cumulative grade point average below 1.0, and</li>
<li>The cumulative grade point average is so low that in view of the student&apos;s overall educational record, it seems unlikely that the deficiency will be removed within a reasonable period.</li>
</ul>
<p>When such action is taken,the student shall be notified via email and writing with an explanation of the basis for the action from the appropriate college dean.</p>
<p>In addition, a student who at any time during enrollment has demonstrated behavior so contrary to the standards of the profession for which the student is preparing as to render him/her unfit for the profession, in such cases, disqualification will occur immediately upon notice to the student, which shall include an explanation of the basis for the action, and the campus may require the student to discontinue enrollment as of the date of the notification. The decision to disqualify a student under these terms shall be made by the appropriate college dean in consultation with the Provost; the college&#xA0;dean shall notify the student.</p>
<p><strong>Reinstatement</strong></p>
<p>If disqualified, you are not eligible for reinstatement for a minimum of one academic year. You will be required to reapply for admission&#xA0;and submit a letter of appeal to the Office of Admissions. The Admissions Exception Committee will review your reinstatement appeal, with approval based upon your documented good-faith effort to improve academic standing and improve circumstances within your control that directly resulted in your disqualification. You will be informed in writing of your status within 30 days of receipt of your completed reinstatement petition. For information regarding reapplication and the petition process, call the Office of Admissions at 582-5100.</p>
<p><strong>Standards of Progress for Veterans</strong></p>
<p>If you are a veteran or an eligible dependent of a veteran receiving educational benefits and you remain on probation for a deficient cumulative&#xA0;grade pont average&#xA0;below 2.0 beyond two semesters, your veteran&apos;s benefits will be discontinued and any further certification of benefits terminated.</p>
