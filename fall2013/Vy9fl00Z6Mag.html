    <span class="print-link"></span><h5>High School Students</h5>
<p>If still enrolled in high school, you will be considered for enrollment in certain special programs if recommended by the principal and the appropriate campus department chair and if preparation is equivalent to that required of eligible California high school graduates. Such admission is only for a given specific program and does not constitute the right to continued enrollment. For participating programs, contact CSUMB Office of Admissions.</p>
<p>High school students other than those accepted into the above programs may also enroll concurrently in college courses without fee reduction upon approval of parents, high school principal, appropriate CSUMB program directors, and Office of Admissions.</p>
<h5>Adult Students</h5>
<p>As an alternative to regular admission criteria, if you are 25 years of age or older, you may be considered for admission as an adult student if you meet all of the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>You possess a high school diploma (or have established equivalence through either General Educational Development or the California High School Proficiency examinations).</li>
<li>You have not been enrolled in college as a fulltime student for more than one term during the past five years.</li>
<li>If you have attended college in the last five years, you have earned a C average or better in all college work attempted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consideration will be based upon a judgment as to whether you are as likely to succeed as a regularly admitted freshman or transfer student and will include an assessment of basic skills in the English language and mathematical computation.</p>
<h5>Summer Session Applicants</h5>
<p>Although CSUMB is not currently on year-round operation, the campus does offer distinctive summer programs, and housing and food services are available. You can get information regarding summer session from:</p>

</ul>
<h5>Over-60 Program</h5>
<p><strong>Effective Fall 2012, CSUMB is not open for students interested in applying to the Over 60 program.</strong>
</p>
<p>The CSU has established a program which allows California residents 60 years of age or older to enroll in regular session courses without payment of certain specified fees and with reduction in the amounts of others. If interested in this program, you must be admissible as stipulated in Title 5 of the California Code of Regulations and you shall, at time of enrollment, register after regular students.&#xA0; Students requesting participation in the Over-60 Program must initiate contact with the Office of Admissions office, prior to the start of the term they wish to be considered.&#xA0; Further information is available from:</p>
<p><strong>Office of Admissions</strong><br>100 Campus Center<br>Seaside, CA 93955-8001<br>831-582-5100<br>Fax 831-582-3783</p>

<ul>
</ul>
<h5>Returning Students</h5>
<p>If you are a former CSUMB student who has been absent for two or more semesters and you were not eligible for a Leave of Absence, you must apply for readmission and pay the application fee. You must submit official transcripts of all college work attempted during your absence from the university. Appropriate campus officials will base readmission decisions on a review of your academic status.</p>
<h6>Former Students Who Were on Academic Probation</h6>
<p>If you were on probation at the end of your last enrollment, you may be readmitted on academic probation provided any work you may have completed elsewhere in the interim is satisfactory. If readmitted on probation, you are subject to such conditions as appropriate university officials may prescribe.</p>
<h6>Former Students Who Were Academically Disqualified</h6>
<p>If a disqualified undergraduate or second baccalaureate degree candidate who has been absent for one or more years, you must apply for readmission and an application fee is charged. Contact Admissions &amp; Records for procedures and documents that must be submitted. Appropriate campus officials will base readmission decisions on a review of your academic status and personal situation. Submit your application as early as possible.</p>
