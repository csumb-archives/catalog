    <span class="print-link"></span> <p>The CSUMB Office of International Programs offers a variety of programs, for students interested in studying overseas or participating in an exchange program within the United States. Some domestic and international programs last for an entire academic year. Others range from just a few weeks to a semester. Whatever your academic program or personal interests, the Office of International Programs undoubtedly offers a program right for you.</p>
<p>A few good reasons to study abroad:</p>
<ul>
<li>To enhance your education. A study abroad or exchange experience adds a new perspective to your studies. You will see things from another point of view, which will help you develop your analytical and critical-thinking skills.</li>
<li>To progress toward graduation. Most domestic or overseas opportunities allow you transfer the credits you take overseas to CSUMB, helping to move you closer to your goal of graduating.</li>
<li>To build your resume. Study in another country or region of the country adds a new dimension to your career planning. In an age of global economies and information super-highways, experience abroad or outside California distinguishes your background from the rest.</li>
<li>To develop your self-awareness. We sometimes impose limitations on ourselves that hinder progress toward our goals. By leaving the familiar behind and encountering different people and places you will gain a better understanding of yourself and the world around you.</li>
<li>To understand another culture. Living and learning in another culture in the midst of the unfamiliar adds to your understanding of the variety of cultures in our world and can give you a maturity and perspective that can be gained in no other way.</li>
</ul>
<h5>CSU International Programs</h5>
<p><span>Developing intercultural communication skills and international understanding among its students is a vital mission of the California State University. Since its inception in 1963, CSU International Programs has contributed to this effort by providing qualified students an affordable opportunity to continue their studies abroad for a full academic year. More than 20,000 CSU students have taken advantage of this unique study option.</span></p>
<p><span>CSU International Programs participants earn resident academic credit at their CSU campuses while pursuing fulltime study at a host university or special study center abroad. CSU International Programs serves the needs of students in over 100 designated academic majors. Affiliated with more than 50 recognized universities and institutions of higher education in 18 countries, CSU International Programs also offers a wide selection of study locales and learning environments.</span></p>
<h5>Other Programs Available to CSUMB Students</h5>
<p>Cultural Experiences Abroad (CEA), SIT Study Abroad, and AustraLearn are just a few more of the overseas options available to you as a CSUMB student. In addition, if you are interested in studying at one of 170 other universities in the USA or Canada while continuing to be enrolled at CSUMB, we offer the National Student Exchange program.</p>
<h5>Integration with Majors</h5>
<p>OIP offers programs applicable to all CSUMB majors.</p>
<h5>Online Components</h5>
