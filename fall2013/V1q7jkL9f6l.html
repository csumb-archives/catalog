    <span class="print-link"></span> <p>Should a student or former student fail to pay a fee or a debt owed to the institution, CSUMB may &quot;withhold permission to register, to use facilities for which a fee is authorized to be charged, to receive services, materials, food or merchandise or any combination of the above from any person owing a debt&quot; until the debt is paid (see Title 5, California Code of Regulations, Sections 42380 and 42381).</p>
<p>Prospective students who register for courses offered by the university are obligated for the payment of tuition and fees, including non-resident tuition fee, associated with registration for those courses. Failure to cancel registration in any course for an academic term prior to the first day of the academic term gives rise to an obligation to pay student fees including any tuition for the reservation of space in the course.</p>
<p>CSUMB may withhold permission to register or to receive official transcripts of grades or other services offered by the institution from anyone owing fees or another debt to the institution.&#xA0;CSUMB&#xA0;may also report the debt to a credit bureau, offset the amount due against any future state tax&#xA0;refunds due to you, or refer the debt to an outside collection agency.</p>
<p>If you believe you do not owe all or part of an asserted unpaid obligation, you may contact Student Accounts Receivable. Student Accounts Receivable, or another office on campus to which Student Accounts Receivable may refer you, will review all pertinent information provided by you and available to the campus and will advise you of its conclusions.</p>
<p>A Business and Finance hold will be placed on all of your academic records until payment is received.</p>
<p>Payment by gauranteed funds (cash, money order, cashier&apos;s check, or online credit card payment) will clear a Business and Finance hold within 2-4 hours.&#xA0; Payment by e-Check will result in a delay of 5-7 business days in clearing the hold and payment by paper check will result in a delay of 7-12 business days in clearing the hold.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>
<h5><strong>Returned Checks (paper and electronic)</strong></h5>
<p>If you pay by personal check (paper or electronic) for any university-related fees or services, you will be assessed a $25 returned check/ACH fee for the first check/ACH not honored by the bank for any reason. <strong>This includes incorrectly entering your account and routing numbers on eCheck (ACH).</strong> The amount of the original check plus the $25 fee becomes a financial obligation to CSUMB. A $20 administrative late fee may also apply. Subsequent returned checks (paper or electronic) will be assessed a $35 returned check/ACH fee. Following the return of a second check/ACH, CSUMB reserves the right to refuse to accept your personal checks (paper or electronic) for any future payments. (Note: CSUMB has no control over whether a bank sends checks through a second time for clearing.)</p>
<p>A Business and Finance hold will be placed on all of your academic records until payment is received.</p>
<p>Payment by gauranteed funds (cash, money order, cashier&apos;s check, or online credit card payment) will clear a Business and Finance hold within 2-4 hours.&#xA0; Payment by e-Check will result in a delay of 5-7 business days in clearing the hold and payment by paper check will result in a delay of 7-12 business days in clearing the hold.</p>
<p>You are hereby given notice that if the bank for any reason does not honor a personal check (paper or electronic) used by you to pay registration fees, your registration is subject to cancellation. Once canceled, you will not be reinstated.</p>
