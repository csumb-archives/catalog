<p>If you find it necessary to cancel your registration or to withdraw from all classes after enrolling for any academic term, you must follow the university&apos;s official withdrawal procedures. Failure to follow these procedures may result in an obligation to pay tuition fees, as well as the assignment of failing grades in courses. Students will need to apply for readmission before being permitted to enroll in another academic term. Information on canceling registration and withdrawal procedures is available from:</p>
<p>The Office of the Registrar<br>Student Services Building<br>100 Campus Center<br>Seaside, CA 93955-8001<br>831-582-3085<br><a href="mailto:records@csumb.edu" rel="nofollow">records@csumb.edu</a></p>
<p>To begin the withdrawal process contact the Office of the Registrar. &#xA0;To formally withdraw from the institution, you must complete the withdrawal process by submitting the withdrawal form, with all required signatures and clearances, to the Office of the Registrar.</p>
<p>If you wish to withdraw from CSUMB after the schedule adjustment period, you may do so for documented serious and compelling reasons (e.g. death in the immediate family, medical complications and legal actions). A grade of <em>W</em> will appear on your transcript for all courses dropped after the schedule adjustment period.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Undergraduate students may withdraw from no more than 18 units at CSU Monterey Bay.</p>
<p>Withdrawals shall not be permitted during the final twenty percent of instruction except in cases, such as accident or serious illness, where the cause of the withdrawal is due to circumstances clearly beyond the student&apos;s control. Withdrawals of this sort may involve total withdrawal from the campus or may involve only one course, except that course grade and credit or an Incomplete may be assigned for courses in which sufficient work has been completed to permit an evaluation to be made.</p>
<p>If you receive financial aid funds, you must consult with the Financial Aid Office prior to withdrawing from the university regarding any required return or repayment of grant or loan assistance received for that academic term or payment period. Students who have received financial aid and withdraw from the institution during the academic term or payment period may need to return or repay some or all of the funds received, which may result in a debt owed to the institution.</p>
