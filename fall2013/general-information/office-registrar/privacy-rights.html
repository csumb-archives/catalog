    <span class="print-link"></span> <p>The federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (20 U.S.C. 1232g) and regulations adopted thereunder (34 C.F.R. 99) set out requirements designed to protect students&apos; privacy in their records maintained by the campus. The statute and regulations govern access to certain student records maintained by the campus and the release of such records. The law provides that the campus must give students access to most records directly related to the student, and must also provide opportunity for a hearing to challenge the records if the student claims they are inaccurate, misleading or otherwise inappropriate. The right to a hearing under this law does not include any right to challenge the appropriateness of a grade determined by the instructor. The law generally requires the institution to receive a student&apos;s written consent before releasing personally identifiable data about the student.</p>
<p>The institution has adopted a set of policies and procedures governing implementation of the statute and the regulations. Copies of these policies and procedures may be obtained from:</p>
<p><strong>Office of the Provost</strong></p>

<li>Administrative Building</li>
<li>100 Campus Center<br>Seaside, CA 93955-8001 </li>

The Department of Education has established an office and review board to investigate complaints and adjudicate violations. The designated office is:</p>

<ul>
<li>U.S. Department of Education<br> 400 Maryland Ave, SW<br> Washington, DC 20202-5920 </li>

<p>The campus is authorized to provide access to student records to campus officials and employees who have legitimate educational interests in such access. These persons have responsibilities in the campus&apos;s academic, administrative or service functions and have reason for accessing student records associated with their campus or other related academic responsibilities. Student records may also be disclosed to other persons or organizations under certain conditions (e.g. as part of accreditation or program evaluation; in response to a court order or subpoena; in connection with financial aid; or to other institutions to which the student is transferring).</p>
