<h6>Special Education Emphasis</h6>
<p>You officially begin the program by enrolling in Clear Level II Mild/Moderate coursework where you work with the instructor to create your Individual Learning Plan. That ILP maps out how you will achieve each of the Learning Outcomes designated above by successfully completing the courses or alternative assessment options listed here. You conclude the program by completing your Culminating Project/Thesis, a publicly presented project that displays your cumulative learning. [Learn more at <a href="http://csumb.edu/capstone" rel="nofollow">CSUMB.EDU/capstone</a>].</p>
<p>As the foundation for your master&apos;s work, you will complete three core courses: ProSeminar, a research methods course and the Culminating Project. The core courses help you develop a theoretical and research base for successful teaching in pluralistic contexts and special education environments. In the research course, you initiate a research project. You complete it in the Culminating Project course.</p>
<p>On top of the core, you must demonstrate competency in a second language through second-semester college level. Coursework in a second language is available as needed, as is assistance in determining level of language competency. If you enter the program with the requisite second language proficiency, you are not required to complete additional coursework. You will also need to demonstrate basic technology competence; coursework is available as part of the program.</p>
<p>In addition to the three core courses there are four required Level II special education courses: <em>Current and Ongoing Research, Policy, and Practice in Special Education; Advanced Assessment, Curriculum, &amp; Instruction for Students with Learning Challenges; Advanced Behavioral, Emotional, &amp; Environmental Supports for Students with Challenges; and Advanced Collaboration &amp; Consultation.</em> Two courses from the Preliminary Credential may apply towards the MAE.</p>
<p>You begin conceptualizing your action thesis/project in ProSeminar special education research course and the research methods course, and continue to work on it while completing your special education coursework. You complete your thesis in the Culminating Project course. You can explore thesis topics of program graduates on the <a href="http://teach.csumb.edu/site/x15816.xml" rel="nofollow">CSUMB.EDU/mae</a> website.</p>
<p>As the foundation for your master&apos;s work, you will complete two core courses:</p>
<ul>
<li>a research methods course ( <a href="/courses/json/mae-621.json" class="course-link">MAE 621</a>: Qualitative/Quantitative Resea)</li>
<li>and the Culminating Project Seminar ( <a href="/courses/json/mae-670.json" class="course-link">MAE 670</a>: MAE Culminating Project)</li>
</ul>
<p>The core courses help you develop a theoretical and research base for successful teaching in pluralistic contexts and special education environments. In the research course you initiate a research project, and in the Culminating Project course you complete it.</p>
<p>In addition to the two core courses there are four required special education courses.</p>
