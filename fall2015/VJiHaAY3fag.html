<p>Applying for Financial Aid does not guarantee an extension of payment for housing, meal plan or registration charges.</p>
<p>To qualify for an extension of payment prior to disenrollment (enrollment cancellation), students must accept their Federal Student Loan awarded on CMS prior to July 30th if the loan is needed to pay the tuition balance.</p>
<p>This extension of payment expires and all outstanding charges are due when all financial aid awards are disbursed to your student account, but no later than the add/drop date of each semester. If housing, meal plan or registration charges are outstanding after these deadlines, late charges will be assessed and holds will be placed on your student record.</p>

</h3>

<p>Under guidelines issued by the CSU Chancellor&apos;s Office, the Tuition Fee Installment Payment Plan (IPP) enables you to defer payment of a portion of the tuition fee only. However, you are not eligible to participate if you receive financial aid, waivers, or other deferments. IPP contracts are available at the Campus Service Center.</p>
<p>To take advantage of this option, turn in a completed-signed contract, along with the first payment, at the Campus Service Center. Payments may be made online or in person. A $33 nonrefundable administrative fee (Ed Code Section 89700.1 &amp; Executive Order 632) will be assessed to cover costs associated with the IPP. Payment amounts and due dates are listed on the IPP contract.</p>
<p>A $20 administrative late payment fee will be assessed for each installment payment not received by the due date. Reminders are not sent, and it is your responsibility to make payments on or before the due dates listed on your contract. A Business and Finance Hold (SF) will be placed on accounts that still show a balance due at the end of the contract.</p>

<p>Regulations governing the refund of mandatory fees, including nonresident tuition, for students enrolling at the California State University are included in Section 41802 of Title 5,<em>California Code of Regulations</em>. For purposes of the refund policy, mandatory fees are defined as those systemwide and campus fees that are required to be paid in order to enroll in state-supported academic programs at the California State University. Refunds of tuition and fee charges for self-support, special session, and extended education programs or courses at the California State University are governed by a separate policy established by the university.</p>

<p>In order to receive a full refund of mandatory tuition and fees, less an administrative charge established by the campus, including nonresident tuition fee, you must cancel registration or drop all courses prior to the first day of instruction for the term. Information on procedures and deadlines for canceling registration and dropping classes is available in the <a href="http://csumb.edu/planning">Classes &amp; Planning</a>  section of the CSUMB.EDU website. You should call the Campus Service Center or check the <a href="http://csumb.edu/calendar">CSUMB.EDU/calendar</a> webpages to determine exact deadline dates for fee refunds.</p>

<p>For state-supported semesters, quarters, and non-standard terms or courses of four (4) weeks or more, a student who withdraws during the term in accordance with the university&apos;s established procedures, or drops all courses prior to the campus-designated drop period will receive a refund of mandatory fees, including nonresident tuition, based on the portion of the term during which the student was enrolled. No student withdrawing after the 60 percent point in the term will be entitled to a refund of any mandatory fees or nonresident tuition.</p>

<p>A student who, within the campus designated drop period and in accordance with the campus procedures, drops units resulting in a lower tuition and/or mandatory fee obligation shall be entitled to a refund of applicable tuition and mandatory fees less an administrative charge established by the campus.</p>

<p>For state-supported non-standard terms or courses of less than four (4) weeks, no refunds of mandatory fees and nonresident tuition will be made unless a student cancels registration or drops all classes, in accordance with the university&apos;s established procedures and deadlines, prior to the first day of instruction for state-supported non-standard terms or courses or prior to the first meeting for courses of less than four (4) weeks.</p>

<p>Students will also receive a refund of mandatory fees, including nonresident tuition, under the following circumstances:</p>

<ul><li>The fees were assessed or collected in error;</li>
<li>The course for which the fees were assessed or collected was cancelled by the university;</li>
<li>The university makes a delayed decision that the student was not eligible to enroll in the term for which mandatory fees were assessed and collected and the delayed decision was not due to incomplete or inaccurate information provided by the student; or</li>
<li>The student was activated for compulsory military service.</li>
</ul>
<p>Students who are not entitled to a refund as described above, you may petition the university for a refund demonstrating exceptional circumstances and the chief financial officer of the university or designee may authorize a refund if it is determined that the mandatory fees, including non-resident tuition fee, were not earned by the university.</p>

<p>Information concerning any aspect of the refund of fees, may be obtained from the Student Accounts Receivable Department, located in the Campus Service Center.</p>

</h3>

<p>All refunds will be assessed an administrative processing fee. Refunds will be applied first toward any required return of funds that had been received by or on behalf of the student from federal, state, institutional, or external sources that were conditioned on the student&apos;s enrollment, and second against other amounts due to CSUMB.</p>

<p>If a student officially drop courses before the end of the add/drop period and it results in a change from full-time to part-time status, the student&apos;s refund will be mailed four to six weeks after the close of the add/drop period. If the student officially withdraws or cancels all classes prior to the 60 percent point in the term, the student&apos;s prorata refund will be mailed four to six weeks from the date that the university receives the student&apos;s official notification.</p>

<p>If a student was awarded financial aid and is withdrawing, the student must see a Financial Aid Office representative to discuss eligibility, rights and responsibilities, reasonable academic progress requirements, and future aid eligibility. If a student was awarded financial aid and fails to officially withdraw, the student may be subject to total aid cancellation. In addition, financial aid monies allocated to the student may need to be refunded to Title 4 programs, or the student may need to repay a portion of the funds received, if the student withdraws, drops out, is expelled, or otherwise becomes ineligible during the payment period. A copy of this policy is available at the Financial Aid Office.</p>

<p>Should a student or former student fail to pay a fee or a debt owed to the institution, CSUMB may &quot;withhold permission to register, to use facilities for which a fee is authorized to be charged, to receive services, materials, food or merchandise or any combination of the above from any person owing a debt&quot; until the debt is paid (see Title 5, California Code of Regulations, Sections 42380 and 42381).</p>
<p>Prospective students who register for courses offered by the university are obligated for the payment of tuition and fees, including non-resident tuition fee, associated with registration for those courses. Failure to cancel registration in any course for an academic term prior to the first day of the academic term gives rise to an obligation to pay student fees including any tuition for the reservation of space in the course.</p>
<p>CSUMB may withhold permission to register or to receive official transcripts of grades or other services offered by the institution from anyone owing fees or another debt to the institution. CSUMB may also report the debt to a credit bureau, offset the amount due against any future state tax refunds due to you, or refer the debt to an outside collection agency and/or charge you actual and reasonable collection costs, including reasonable attorney fees if litigation is necessary, in collecting any amount not paid when due.</p>
<p>If you believe you do not owe all or part of an asserted unpaid obligation, you may contact Student Accounts Receivable. Student Accounts Receivable, or another office on campus to which Student Accounts Receivable may refer you, will review all pertinent information provided by you and available to the campus and will advise you of its conclusions.</p>
<p>A Business and Finance hold will be placed on all of your academic records until payment is received.</p>
<p>Payment by guaranteed funds (cash, money order, cashier&apos;s check, or online credit card payment) will clear a Business and Finance hold within 24 hours.  Payment by e-Check will result in a delay of 5-7 business days in clearing the hold and payment by paper check will result in a delay of 7-12 business days in clearing the hold.</p>

<p>If you pay by personal check (paper or electronic) for any university-related fees or services, you will be assessed a $25 returned check/ACH fee for the first check/ACH not honored by the bank for any reason. <strong>This includes incorrectly entering your account and routing numbers on eCheck (ACH).</strong> The amount of the original check plus the $25 fee becomes a financial obligation to CSUMB. A $20 administrative late fee may also apply. Subsequent returned checks (paper or electronic) will be assessed a $35 returned check/ACH fee. Following the return of a second check/ACH, CSUMB reserves the right to refuse to accept your personal checks (paper or electronic) for any future payments. (Note: CSUMB has no control over whether a bank sends checks through a second time for clearing.)</p>
<p>A Business and Finance hold will be placed on all of your academic records until payment is received.</p>
<p>Payment by guaranteed funds (cash, money order, cashier&apos;s check, or online credit card payment) will clear a Business and Finance hold within 24 hours.  Payment by e-Check will result in a delay of 5-7 business days in clearing the hold and payment by paper check will result in a delay of 7-12 business days in clearing the hold.</p>
<p>You are hereby given notice that if the bank for any reason does not honor a personal check (paper or electronic) used by you to pay registration fees, your registration is subject to cancellation. Once canceled, you will not be reinstated.</p>
