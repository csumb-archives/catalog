<p>CSUMB accepts only electronic applications. Electronic versions of the CSU undergraduate and graduate applications are accessible on the <a href="http://www.csumentor.edu/">CSUmentor.edu</a> website. CSU Mentor allows you to browse through general information about CSU&apos;s 23 campuses, view multimedia campus presentations, send and receive electronic responses to specific questions, and apply for admission and financial aid.</p>
<p>Applying online via <a href="http://www.csumentor.edu/">CSUmentor.edu</a> is expected unless electronic submission is impossible. An acknowledgement will be sent when online applications have been submitted. Application in &#x201C;hard copy&#x201D; form may be obtained online via <a href="http://csumentor.edu/">CSUmentor.edu</a> as a portable data format (PDF). Application forms (in PDF) may also be downloaded from <a href="http://www.calstate.edu/sas/publications">www.calstate.edu/sas/publications</a>. [Paper applications should be mailed to the campus admission office.]</p>
<p>If you would like to enroll as a matriculated student, you must file an application for admission for either the fall or spring semester. If you have been in attendance at CSUMB during either of the two preceding semesters, you qualify as a continuing student and do not need to reapply or pay the $55 application fee. After an absence of two or more semesters, an application and fee are necessary when re-entering CSUMB, but applications are not required for students desiring to enroll only in extension or intersession.</p>

<p>CSUMB advises you that you must supply complete and accurate information on the application for admission, residency questionnaire and financial aid forms. Further, you must, when requested, submit authentic and official transcripts of all previous academic work attempted. Failure to file complete, accurate and authentic application documents may result in denial of admission, cancellation of registration or academic credit, suspension or expulsion (Section 41301, Article 1.1, Title 5, California Code of Regulations).</p>

<p>You must include your correct social security number in designated places on applications for admission pursuant to the authority contained in Section 41201, Title 5, California Code of Regulations, and Section 6109 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 6109). The university uses the social security number to identify you and your records including identification for purposes of financial aid eligibility and disbursement and the repayment of financial aid and other debts payable to the institution. Also, the Internal Revenue Service requires the university to file information returns that include your social security number and other information such as the amount paid for qualified tuition, related expenses, and interest on educational loans. The IRS uses this information to help determine whether you, or a person claiming you as a dependent, may take a credit or deduction to reduce federal income taxes.</p>

</h2>

<p>Prospective students applying for part-time or full-time undergraduate programs of study must submit a completed undergraduate application. The $55 nonrefundable application fee should be in the form of a check or money order payable to <em>California State University</em> or by credit card if submitting the online application, and may not be transferred or used to apply to another term. An alternate major may be indicated on the application. The applications of persons denied admission to an impacted or closed campus may be rerouted to another campus at no cost, but only if the applicant is CSU-eligible.</p>

<p>The majors offered at CSUMB are listed in the Undergraduate Education section of this catalog. You should review these descriptions before filing an application. CSUMB accepts students who are undecided about their major. If undecided, use the undeclared category on the application form.</p>

        IMPACTED PROGRAMS    <a class="anchor-link" href="applications.html#impacted-programs">
    <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span>
  </a>
</h3>

<p>The CSU designates programs as impacted when more applications from regularly eligible applicants are received in the initial filing period (October and November for fall terms, June for winter terms, August for spring terms, February for summer terms) than can be accommodated. Some programs are impacted at every campus which they are offered; others are impacted only at a few campuses. Candidates for admission must meet all of the campus&#x2019; specified supplementary admission criteria if applying to an impacted program or campus.</p>
<p>The CSU will announce during the fall filing period those campuses or programs that are impacted. Detailed information on campus and programs impaction will be available at the following websites:</p>

<ul><li><a href="http://www.csumentor.edu/">www.csumentor.edu</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.calstate.edu/impactioninfo.shtml">www.calstate.edu/impactioninfo.shtml</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.calstate.edu/sas/impaction-campus-info.shtml">www.calstate.edu/sas/impaction-campus-info.shtml</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Campuses will communicate its supplementary admission criteria for all impacted programs to high schools and community colleges in their service area and will disseminate this information to the public through appropriate media. This information will also be published at the CSU campus individual website and made available online at <a href="http://www.calstate.edu./">www.calstate.edu.</a></p>
<p>You must file your application for admission to an impacted program during the initial filing period. If you wish to be considered in impacted programs at more than one campus, you should file an application at each campus for which you seek admission consideration.</p>

<h4 id="supplementary-admission-criteria">
        Supplementary Admission Criteria    <a class="anchor-link" href="applications.html#supplementary-admission-criteria">
    <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span>
  </a>
</h4>

<p>Each campus with impacted programs uses supplementary admission criteria in screening applicants. Supplementary criteria may include rank-ordering of freshman applicants based on the CSU eligibility index or rank-ordering of transfer applicants based on the verification of AA-T or AS-T degree, the overall transfer grade point average (GPA), completion of specified prerequisite courses, and a combination of campus-developed criteria. Applicants for freshman admission to impacted campuses or programs are required to submit scores on either the SAT or the ACT. For fall admission, you should take tests as early as possible, but no later than November or December of the preceding year.</p>
<p>The supplementary admission criteria used by the individual campuses to screen applicants are made available by the campuses to all applicants seeking admission to an impacted program. Details regarding the supplemental admissions criteria are also provided at <a href="http://calstate.edu/AR/impactioninfo.shtml">calstate.edu/impactioninfo.shtml</a>.</p>

        Graduate    <a class="anchor-link" href="applications.html#graduate">
    <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span>
  </a>
</h2>

<p>All graduate and postbaccalaureate applicants (e.g. Ed.D., joint Ph.D. and Ed.D. applicants, master&apos;s degree applicants, those seeking educational credentials or certificates, and where permitted, holders of baccalaureate degrees interested in taking courses for personal or professional growth), must file a complete graduate application as described in the graduate and postbaccalaureate admission materials at <a href="http://www.csumentor.edu/">CSUMentor.edu</a>.</p>
<p>If seeking a second bachelor&apos;s degree, you should submit the graduate application for admission. If you completed undergraduate degree requirements and graduated the preceding term, you are also required to complete and submit an application and the $55 nonrefundable application fee.</p>
<p>Since applicants for postbaccalaureate programs may be limited to the choice of a single campus on each application, rerouting to alternate campuses or later changes of campus choice are not guaranteed. To be assured of initial consideration by more than one campus, it is necessary to submit separate applications (including fees) to each.</p>
<p>Applications submitted by way of <a href="http://www.csumentor.edu/">CSUMentor.edu</a> are expected unless submission of an electronic application is impossible. An electronic version of the CSU graduate application is available on the <a href="http://www.csumentor.edu/">CSUMentor.edu</a>website.</p>
<p>You should refer to individual graduate and credential program descriptions for information on specific admission requirements. Individual master&apos;s and credential programs provide supplemental application materials to applicants. You must submit all application materials by the established deadline. You must also request that each postsecondary institution you have attended send two official copies of your transcripts directly to the CSUMB Office of Admissions. These transcripts must arrive by the application deadline. When required, you must also submit test scores by the application deadline.</p>
<p>If you have attended CSUMB in the past, either as a graduate or an undergraduate student, you do not need to submit your CSUMB transcript or additional copies of transcripts you have already submitted to CSUMB.</p>

<p>Each non-impacted campus accepts applications until capacities are reached. Many campuses limit undergraduate admission in an enrollment category due to overall enrollment limits. If applying after the initial filing period, consult the campus admission office for current information. Similar information is conveniently available at <a href="http://www.csumentor.edu/filing_status/">www.csumentor.edu/filing_status/default.asp</a>.</p>
<p>If any enrollment categories are not filled during the initial filing period, CSUMB will continue to accept applications until capacity is reached. Enrollment priority within the extended period will be in the order that applications are received.</p>
<p>Contact Office of Admissions to confirm deadlines and policies, or visit the <a href="http://www.csumentor.edu/">CSUMentor</a><a href="http://www.csumentor.edu/">.edu</a> website for current deadlines.</p>

</h2>

<p>If you apply on time, you may expect to receive an acknowledgment from the campuses to which you have applied within two to four weeks of filing the application. The notice may include a request that you submit additional records necessary to evaluate your academic qualifications. You may be assured of admission if the evaluation of your relevant qualifications indicates that you meet CSU admission requirements, and in the case of admission impaction, supplemental criteria for admission to an impacted program. Unless you receive specific written confirmation/approval, an offer of admission is not transferable to another term or to another campus.</p>
