<h3 class="Title">Mathematics, B. S. ~ Degree Requirements</h3><h5>Degree Requirements</h5>

<h6>Semester Credits Required</h6>

<p>Total credits: 124</p>

<p>Credits in the major: 60</p>

<h5>Outcomes, Courses, and Assessment</h5>

<p>Although you officially begin the major when you enroll in the <em>MATH 300 Major ProSeminar</em>, we encourage you to contact a mathematics faculty advisor as soon as possible. In the Major ProSeminar you will work with the instructor to create your Individual Learning Plan. This ILP maps out how you will achieve each of the Major Learning Outcomes designated below. Your degree culminates in a publicly presented project that displays your cumulative learning in the major. [Learn more at <a href="http://csumb.edu/capstone" target="_blank">CSUMB.EDU/capstone</a>].</p>

<p><em>Assessment for Essential Learning Outcomes</em></p>

<p>MLOs 9-14 cover knowledge and skills common to all mathematics content areas. These outcomes are central to student success. Because they take time to develop, you receive <em>formative assessment</em> on each within these upper-division mathematics courses: <em>MATH 320 Statistics and Probability; MATH 325 Number Theory; MATH 326 History Mathematics; MATH 329 College Geometry; MATH 330 Linear Algebra; MATH 340 Differential Equations; MATH 370 Logic and Computation</em></p>

<p>You can complete your assessment for these MLOs by earning a C or better in the Capstone sequence of MATH 400 and MATH 401, or by demonstrating <em>mastery</em> in these 400-level courses: <em>MATH 411 Modern Algebra II; MATH 420 Mathematical Analysis I; MATH 421 Mathematical Analysis II; MATH 400 Capstone I; MATH 401 Capstone II</em></p>

<p>The assessment process includes a variety of approaches, such as student performances, presentations, projects, portfolios, observations, and interviews, as well as oral and written examinations.</p>&#xA0;
