<h3 class="Title">Policies &amp; Regulations ~ Privacy Rights of Students in Education Records</h3> <p><font color="dimgray">The federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (20 U.S.C. 1232g) and regulations adopted thereunder (34 C.F.R. 99) set out requirements designed to protect students&#x2019; privacy in their records maintained by the campus. The statute and regulations govern access to student records maintained by the campus and the release of such records. The law provides that the campus must give students access to records directly related to the student, and must also provide opportunity for a hearing to challenge the records if the student claims they are inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise inappropriate. The right to a hearing under this law does not include any right to challenge the appropriateness of a grade determined by the instructor. The law generally requires the institution to receive a student&#x2019;s written consent before releasing personally identifiable data about the student.</font></p> <p><font color="dimgray">The institution has adopted a set of policies and procedures governing implementation of the statute and the regulations. Copies of these policies and procedures may be obtained from:</font></p> <p><strong>Office of the Provost</strong></p> <ul> <li>Building 1<br> 100 Campus Center<br> Seaside, <a href="/courses/json/ca-93955.json" class="course-link"><a href="/courses/json/ca-93955.json" class="course-link">CA 93955</a></a>-8001</li> <li>831-582-3680</li> <li><a href="mailto:provost@csumb.edu">provost@csumb.edu</a></li> <li><a href="http://policy.csumb.edu">http://policy.csumb.edu</a></li>
</ul> <p><font color="dimgray">Among the types of information included in the campus statement of policies and procedures are: (1) the types of student records maintained and the information they contain; (2) the official responsible for maintaining each type of record; (3) the location of access lists indicating persons requesting or receiving information from the record; (4) policies for reviewing and expunging records; (5) student access rights to their records; (6) the procedures for challenging the content of student records; (7) the cost to be charged for reproducing copies of records; and (8) the right of the student to file a complaint with the Department of Education. The Department of Education has established an office and review board to investigate complaints and adjudicate violations. The designated office is:</font></p> <p><strong><font color="dimgray">Family Policy Compliance Office</font></strong></p> <ul> <li><font color="dimgray">U.S. Department of Education<br> Washington, DC&#xA0; 20202-4605</font></li>
</ul> <p><font color="dimgray">The campus is authorized under the act to release <em>directory information</em> concerning students. Directory information may include the student&#x2019;s name, address, telephone listing, electronic mail address, photograph, date and place of birth, major field of study, participation in officially recognized activities and sports, weight and height of members of athletic teams, dates of attendance, grade level, enrollment status, degrees, honors, and awards received, and the most recent previous educational agency or institution attended by the student. The above-designated information is subject to release by the campus at any time unless the campus has received prior written objection from the student specifying what information the student requests not be released. Written objections should be sent to:</font></p> <h5>Admissions &amp; Records</h5> <ul> <li>Building 47<br> 100 Campus Center<br> Seaside, CA 93955-8001</li> <li>831-582-5100</li> <li>Fax 831-582-3783</li> <li><a href="mailto:admissions@csumb.edu">admissions@csumb.edu</a></li> <li><a href="http://csumb.edu/admissions">CSUMB.EDU/admissions</a></li>
</ul> <p><font color="dimgray">The campus is authorized to provide access to student records to campus officials and employees who have legitimate educational interests in such access. These persons have responsibilities in the campus&#x2019;s academic, administrative or service functions and have reason for using student records associated with their campus or other related academic responsibilities. Student records may also be disclosed to other persons or organizations under certain conditions (e.g. as part of accreditation or program evaluation; in response to a court order or subpoena; in connection with financial aid; or to other institutions to which the student is transferring).</font></p>
