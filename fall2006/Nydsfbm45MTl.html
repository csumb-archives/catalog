</table><p>Liberal Studies Distributed offers upper-division students an alternative to regular on-campus class sessions. The program, approved by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, allows students to complete most or all of their upper-division coursework online.</p>

<h5>What does distributed mean?</h5>

<p>Distributed learning means that learning occurs in a variety of modes and places, responsive to the needs of the learner. Distributed learning can include face-to-face sessions as well as online activities; work on campus, in communities, and on the Internet; video transmissions and computer-based multimedia programs; and much more. Distributed learning overcomes time and distance barriers with diverse teaching and learning strategies that ensure both access and success for learners.</p>

<h5>Can I complete my degree entirely online without going to the CSUMB campus?</h5>

<p>No, not at this time. Some of our classes are completely online, while others meet on campus or at a fieldsite from one to four times during the semester for orientation, assessment, labs, or special sessions. Since this is a relatively new program, we are adapting more online courses every semester, but not every course is available in the online format at this time. Depending on how quickly you progress through the degree program, a specific course may not be available online by the time you wish to take it. Our plan is to develop online courses for every Liberal Studies Major Learning Outcome, but at this stage of our program&apos;s development, some students choose to mix online courses with on-campus classes to complete their degrees. Others complete outcomes at community colleges or take the online classes as they become available.</p>

<h5>What courses does CSUMB offer online to help me achieve the Liberal Studies outcomes?</h5>

<h5>Will I miss out on the learning that occurs in a traditional classroom environment?</h5>

<p>Online discussions take the place of in-class sessions. You can expect regular communication with your classmates and your instructor, collaboration with other learners, group problem solving, and other interactive learning activities. Online exchange provides an advantage as it gives you time to develop your contributions and to reflect on the input of others.</p>

<h5>Is there a time demand difference between on campus courses and online learning?</h5>

<p>Online courses demand as much study time as other upper-division courses. The big differences are that you decide what time of day you will &quot;attend class,&quot; and you won&apos;t waste any time commuting to get there. As such, this program is perfect for those who live a long way from a university campus and for those trying to squeeze their education into a schedule that is already busy due to a fulltime job, childcare responsibilities, or other important demands. On the other hand, it only fits well if you are a highly motivated student with good time management skills. The courses do have set beginning and ending dates, with key outcomes required along the way to assist you in keeping on schedule and meeting your academic goals.</p>

<h5>What do I need to get into Liberal Studies Distributed?</h5>

<ol>
  <li>A computer (Pentium or equivalent) with Internet access</li>

  <li>Availability for some scheduled meetings on campus or at fieldsites late in the afternoon or on Saturday<br>
  A few of our online courses may have from one to four meetings scheduled during the semester for presentations, assessments, or orientation.</li>

  <li>Completed lower-division courses<br>
  Transfer students must have at least 56 transferable units, including at least 30 general education units that include written communication, oral communication, quantitative reasoning, and critical thinking.</li>

  <li>A minimum GPA of 2.00 for California residents and 2.40 for nonresidents</li>
</ol>

<h5>What courses should I take to prepare for entry into the Liberal Studies Distributed major?</h5>

<p>In order to transfer as a junior to any CSU campus, you are required to complete, with grades of C or better, courses in written communication, oral communication, critical thinking, and quantitative reasoning. In addition, it is recommended that you complete U.S. history and government (U.S. and California), world history, life science and physical science, a physical education activity course, dance, and three semesters of a second language before entry into the LSDC program. Except for Intermediate Spanish, these courses are not offered online at CSUMB at the present time. Finally, while courses in those areas will be available online at CSUMB in the future, it is possible to complete art, music, and drama at a community college.</p>

<h5>How much will it cost to get my Liberal Studies degree?</h5>

<p>LSDC students pay the same fees for their courses as other CSUMB students pay for on-campus courses. Please see the <em>Tuition/Fees</em> section of the catalog for current undergraduate fees for fulltime (more than six credits) and part-time (up to six credits) students.</p>

<p>Your total costs will depend on how many courses you take each semester and which outcomes you have already achieved through prior coursework and other learning experiences.</p>

<p>You may qualify for financial aid that will help defray your costs. To be eligible for financial aid at CSUMB, you must complete the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid). You can do this online (fafsa.ed.gov). The CSUMB Financial Aid Code for entry on your FAFSA application is 032603. (Note: After your application is submitted, the process takes approximately four to six weeks.) In addition to completing the FAFSA, you should call our financial aid office for information on local grants and scholarships. Ask about our Presidential Access Loan program if you need help acquiring a computer for this program. Also, keep in mind that some employers offer educational aid for employees and their families.</p>

<h5>How do I get started?</h5>

<p>If you need more information before applying, contact CSUMB Admissions &amp; Recruitment regarding pre-admission counseling, the application process, fees, and financial aid.</p>

<p>If not yet enrolled at CSUMB, you can apply online (csumentor.edu). Be sure to select &quot;Liberal Studies Degree Completion B.A.&quot; as your major. Submit official transcripts from all previously attended colleges along with the $55 application fee or an approved application waiver.</p>

<p>If you are a current CSUMB student, please contact the Liberal Studies Distributed Academic Coordinator to discuss changing your major.</p>

<h5>Faculty Quotes</h5>

<p>Whether you have a demanding work schedule, family responsibilities, or want to spend your time completing coursework instead of driving long distances to university classes, becoming an &quot;online Otter&quot; in CSUMB&apos;s Liberal Studies Distributed major can provide the flexibility you want in finishing your degree.<br>
