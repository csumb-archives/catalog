Distributed by Margaret Keith, Coordinator, Student Disability Resources</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">CSUMB welcomes and accommodates students with disabilities as part of campus diversity and to comply with federal and state law.&#xA0; Procedures for accommodation are below.</font></p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial" size="2">Welcome Students With Disabilities&#xA0;to Identify Needs</font></strong></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Create a positive climate:&#xA0;announce in several class meetings, on your syllabus and reading list, post on board and course web materials, and repeat two weeks before each assessment/exam how students can request accommodations.&#xA0; For example, &#x201C;Students with disabilities who may need accommodations please see me as soon as possible during office hours or make an appointment by calling xxxx or e-mailing xxxx.&#x201D;&#xA0; You may specify a date by which they must contact you, after the Add/Drop date.&#xA0; In most cases, SDR does not give advance notice about disabled students who may be in your course; it is the student&#x2019;s responsibility to contact you.&#xA0; We urge students to come to SDR early in each semester and to contact you in the first three weeks of the semester with specific accommodations requests.</font></p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial" size="2">CSUMB has many learners with non-visible disabilities.<br></font></strong><strong><br></strong><font face="Arial" size="2">Refer to the brochure &#x201C;College Students with Learning Disabilities&#x201D; available in many academic departments and from SDR.&#xA0; Also, our yellow flyer, &#x201C;What Is It Like to Have a Learning Disability&#x201D; may help you identify students who have not yet been assessed for learning disabilities.&#xA0; Many non-visible disabilities require accommodations that are the same as for students with other disabilities.&#xA0; Some non-visible disabilities are:</font></p>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Learning disabilities such as visual processing disorders, dyscalculia, dyslexia, etc.<br>
  <br></font></li>

  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Psychological diagnoses such as Attention Deficit Disorder, hyperactivity, depression, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, bipolar (manic depressive illness), etc.<br>
  <br></font></li>

  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Hard of hearing and not using hearing aid or sign language interpreter.<br>
  <br></font></li>

  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Other chronic medical conditions such as arthritis, asthma, cancer, diabetes, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, heart conditions, HIV/AIDS, multiple sclerosis, seizure disorders, etc.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><br>
<strong><font face="Arial" size="2">Ensure confidentiality:</font></strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Meet during office hours or other private time.<br>
  <br></font></li>

  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Request student&#x2019;s permission to discuss needs via e-mail and to talk with appropriate employees about how to accommodate.<br>
  <br></font></li>

  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Focus on functional needs and accommodations, not diagnosis or medical label.<br>
  <br></font></li>

  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Only disclose disability-related information to those who need to know in order to accommodate the student.<br>
  <br></font></li>

  <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Do not put disability-related information in academic records.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Respond promptly with approval of request or denial of request within five business days of when the student made the request to you or your department.&#xA0; When students identify needs, communicate clearly the roles and responsibilities of faculty, student and others.&#xA0; Contact Student Disability Resources if you have any questions or comments about the student&#x2019;s request or how best to implement an accommodation.&#xA0; Confirm expectations and arrangements in writing.&#xA0; After accommodations are provided, get feedback from the student about effectiveness of the accommodation.&#xA0; Make appropriate adjustments.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Faculty are not expected to lower expectations or evaluation standards.&#xA0; Students with disabilities are CSUMB eligible.&#xA0; The important thing is to provide effective and timely accommodations so that students have equal opportunity for learning and demonstrating their mastery of the material.</font></p>

<h4>Typical Accommodations:</h4>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Auditory aids:</strong></font></p>

<blockquote dir="ltr">
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Taped lectures, class meetings and reading materials.&#xA0; Students who process information primarily through auditory perception and who have difficulties taking notes may greatly benefit from taping class.&#xA0; Students need to obtain permission from the instructor and instructors may require students to sign an agreement that they will not share the taped information (contact SDR if needed).</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Books on tape and/or electronic books</strong></font></p>

<blockquote dir="ltr">
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Books/texts which can be read via computer and adaptive software can greatly benefit many students.&#xA0; To accommodate student needs for taped materials in a timely manner, faculty need to provide reading lists and syllabi in advance and may need to allow extensions if taped materials are late.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p dir="ltr"><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Facilitate discussion:</strong>&#xA0;</font></p>

<blockquote dir="ltr">
  <p dir="ltr"><font face="Arial" size="2">Establish ground rules for class discussions and maintain them such as only one person talks at a time.&#xA0; If a student chooses to self-disclose disability-related needs to the class, support the class in meeting those needs.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Notetakers:</strong></font></p>

<blockquote dir="ltr">
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Student Disability Resources, instructor, and/or student identifies classmate to take notes and copy them for student so student can focus on instructor (or occasionally miss class to attend to disability needs).&#xA0; Instructor checks privately with student about notetaking needs during small group assignments in which course notetaker might be in separate group.&#xA0; During office ours, instructor writes down for student and expectations or information discussed.&#xA0; Instructor provides copies of large screen presentations and can require through SDR a signed agreement about copyright and use of this intellectual material.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Additional explanation time in class or office hours:</strong></font></p>

<blockquote dir="ltr">
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In addition to CSUMB tutoring at the Academic Skills Achievement Program, students may need more faculty assistance with understanding and organizing course material.&#xA0; Establish clear expectations in each appointment or session.&#xA0; See flyer &#x201C;Suggestions for Helping Students with Learning Disabilities to Write&#x201D;.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Alternative Testing/assessments:</strong></font></p>

<blockquote dir="ltr">
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">These require the most coordination between faculty and SDR.&#xA0; Tests may need to be scheduled at a different time due to side effects of medications or sleep patterns; students may need use of a computer for essays or short answers; some students can not demonstrate their knowledge of the material through multiple choice or fill in blank formats, so an alternate test may be needed or oral presentation instead of written; some students may need a scribe, large print, or Braille or audio taped test.&#xA0; In some cases it is appropriate to provide access to a few notes such as a pre-authorized list of formulas, theories, or names.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Faculty arranges for extra time and schedules a room with few distractions.&#xA0; The alternate test environment must afford the same benefits to the student as were available to other students in the class.&#xA0; Faculty designate an appropriate faculty member or teaching assistant who will be available during the alternate test time or near the alternate room to answer questions.&#xA0; Faculty can ask Student Disability Resources to provide a test proctor. The SDR proctor will administer the test with the appropriate accommodations.&#xA0;&#xA0; SDR usually needs two weeks advance notice to schedule a proctor.</font></p>
