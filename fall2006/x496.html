<h5>Required Tests for Future Teachers</h5>

<p>In California, students wanting to become teachers need to pass two standardized tests prior to entering a teaching credential program. The California Basic Educational Skills Test (CBEST) evaluates competency in basic reading, writing, mathematics, critical analysis and evaluation, and comprehension. Most students should take this test in their sophomore or junior year. More information can be obtained from the <a href="http://www.cbest.nesinc.com">cbest.nesinc.com</a> website.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the Liberal Studies major, in order to enter a Multiple Subjects (Elementary School) Teacher Education Credential Program, students must pass the California Subject Examination for Teachers--Multiple Subjects (CSET). This examination is used to demonstrate competency in the subject areas completed as part of the Liberal Studies program and taught in K-8 curricula: mathematics; English writing, reading, and literature; history and social science; visual and performing arts; science; physical education and development; human development; linguistics; and cultural diversity. Most students take this test in their senior year. More information can be obtained from the <a href="http://www.cbest.nesinc.com">cset.nesinc.com</a> website.</p>
