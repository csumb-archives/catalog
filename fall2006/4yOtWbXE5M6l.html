</table><p>California State University, Monterey Bay (CSUMB) is envisioned as a comprehensive state university which values service through high quality education. The campus will be distinctive in serving the diverse people of California, especially the working class and historically undereducated and low-income populations. It will feature an enriched living and learning environment and year-round operation. The identity of the university will be framed by substantive commitment to multilingual, multicultural, gender-equitable learning. The university will be a collaborative, intellectual community distinguished by partnerships with existing institutions both public and private, cooperative agreements which enable students, faculty, and staff to cross institutional boundaries for innovative instruction, broadly defined scholarly and creative activity, and coordinated community service.</p>

<p>The university will invest in preparation for the future through integrated and experimental use of technologies as resources to people, catalysts for learning, and providers of increased access and enriched quality learning. The curriculum of CSUMB will be student and society centered and of sufficient breadth and depth to meet statewide and regional needs, specifically those involving both inner-city and isolated rural populations, and needs relevant to communities in the immediate Tri-County region (Monterey, Santa Cruz, and San Benito). The programs of instruction will strive for distinction, building on regional assets in developing specialty clusters in such areas as: the sciences (marine, atmospheric, and environmental); visual and performing arts and related humanities; languages, cultures, and international studies; education; business; studies of human behavior, information, and communication, within broad curricular areas; and professional study.</p>

<p>The university will develop a culture of innovation in its overall conceptual design and organization, and will utilize new and varied pedagogical and instructional approaches including distance learning. Institutional programs will value and cultivate creative and productive talents of students, faculty, and staff, and seek ways to contribute to the economy of the state, the wellbeing of our communities, and the quality of life and development of its students, faculty, and service areas.</p>

<p>The education programs at CSUMB will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Integrate the sciences, the arts and humanities, liberal studies, and professional training;</li>

  <li>Integrate modern learning technology and pedagogy to create liberal education adequate for the contemporary world;</li>

  <li>Integrate work and learning, service and reflection;</li>

  <li>Recognize the importance of global interdependence;</li>

  <li>Invest in languages and cross-cultural competence;</li>

  <li>Emphasize those topics most central to the local area&apos;s economy and ecology, and California&apos;s long-term needs;</li>

  <li>Offer a multicultural, gender-equitable, intergenerational, and accessible residential learning environment.</li>
</ul>

<p>The university will provide a new model of organizing, managing, and financing higher education:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The university will be integrated with other institutions, essentially collaborative in its orientation, and active in seeking partnerships across institutional boundaries. It will develop and implement various arrangements for sharing courses, curriculum, faculty, students, and facilities with other institutions.</li>

  <li>The organizational structure of the university will reflect a belief in the importance of each administrative staff and faculty member, working to integrate the university community across &quot;staff&quot; and &quot;faculty&quot; lines.</li>

  <li>The financial aid system will emphasize a fundamental commitment to equity and access.</li>

  <li>The budget and financial systems, including student fees, will provide for efficient and effective operation of the university.</li>

  <li>University governance will be exercised with a substantial amount of autonomy and independence within a very broad CSU systemwide policy context.</li>

  <li>Accountability will emphasize careful evaluation and assessment of results and outcomes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our vision of the goals of California State University, Monterey Bay includes: a model pluralistic academic community where all learn and teach one another in an atmosphere of mutual respect and pursuit of excellence; a faculty and staff motivated to excel in their respective fields as well as to contribute to the broadly defined university environment. Our graduates will have an understanding of interdependence and global competence, distinctive technical and educational skills, the experience and abilities to contribute to California&apos;s high quality work force, the critical thinking abilities to be productive citizens, and the social responsibility and skills to be community builders. CSUMB will dynamically link the past, present, and future by responding to historical and changing conditions, experimenting with strategies which increase access, improve quality, and lower costs through education in a distinctive CSU environment. University students and personnel will attempt analytically and creatively to meet critical state and regional needs, and to provide California with responsible and creative leadership for the global 21st century.</p>
