    <h1>2016-17 Tuition, Fees, and Deadlines</h1>
    <p>   The CSU makes every effort to keep student costs to a minimum. Fees listed in published schedules or student accounts may need to be increased when public funding is inadequate. Therefore, CSU must reserve the right, even after initial fee payments are made, to increase or modify any listed fee. All listed fees, other than mandatory systemwide fees, are subject to change without notice, until the date when instruction for a particular semester or quarter has begun. All CSU listed fees should be regarded as estimates that are subject to change upon approval by The Board of Trustees, the Chancellor, or the Presidents, as appropriate. Changes in mandatory systemwide fees will be made in accordance with the requirements of the Working Families Student Fee Transparency and Accountability Act (Sections 66028 &#x2013; 66028.6 of the Education Code).</p>
<p>The following reflects applicable systemwide fees for semester campuses. These rates are subject to change.</p>

      Procedure for Establishment or Abolishment of Campus-based Mandatory Fees
  <a class="anchor-link" href="#section-procedure-for-establishment-or-abolishment-of-campus-based-mandatory-fees"><span class="icon-link"></span></a>
</h3>

<p>   The law governing the California State University provides that specific campus fees defined as mandatory, such as a student body association fee and a student body center fee, may be established. A student body association fee must be established upon a favorable vote of two-thirds of the students voting in an election held for this purpose (Education Code, Section89300). The campus President may adjust the student body association fee only after the fee adjustment has been approved by a majority of students voting in a referendum established for that purpose. The required fee shall be subject to referendum at any time upon the presentation of a petition to the campus President containing the signatures of 10 percent of the regularly enrolled students at the University. Student body association fees support a variety of cultural and recreational programs, childcare centers, and special student support programs. A student body center fee may be established only after a fee referendum is held which approves by a two-thirds favorable vote the establishment of the fee (Education Code, Section 89304). Once bonds are issued, authority to set and adjust student body center fees is governed by provisions of the State University Revenue Bond Act of 1947, including, but not limited to, Education Code sections 90012, 90027, and 90068.</p>
<p>The process to establish and adjust other campus-based mandatory fees requires consideration by the campus fee advisory committee and a student referendum as established by Executive Order 1102, Section III. The campus President may use alternate consultation mechanisms if he/she determines that a referendum is not the best mechanism to achieve appropriate and meaningful consultation. Results of the referendum and the fee committee review are advisory to the campus President. The President may adjust campus-based mandatory fees but must request the Chancellor to establish a new mandatory fee. The President shall provide to the campus fee advisory committee a report of all campus-based mandatory fees. The campus shall report annually to the Chancellor a complete inventory of all campus-based mandatory fees.</p>
<p>For more information or questions, please contact the Budget Office in the CSU Chancellor&#x2019;s Office at (562) 951-4560.</p>


<h4 id="section-fee-allocation">
      Fee Allocation
  <a class="anchor-link" href="#section-fee-allocation"><span class="icon-link"></span></a>
</h4>

<p>A fee advisory committee comprised of a student majority provides advice to the campus president about charging student fees and allocating campus-based fee revenue. Resources from the materials, services, and facilities fee are used to support a variety of services, and currently are allocated to support health services, instructionally-related activities, transportation, childcare, and university services (includes ID card, transcripts, campus catalog, graduation/diploma). The allocation to transportation supports alternative modes of transportation, including the shuttle service, but does not include a parking permit. If you elect to purchase a parking permit, you will pay an additional fee as noted in Other Fees and Charges.  </p>

<p>Student Involvement and Representation Fee (SIRF): $2.00</p>
<p>On January 28, 2015 the CSU Board of Trustees established a new voluntary student fee, the Student Involvement and Representation Fee, which went into effect in the fall 2015 term. This fee is charged to all students unless they choose to opt out of the fee.  Those students who wish to opt out may do so by navigating to their Student Center and viewing their Account Activity page, which is accessed by a drop-down menu in the Finance section.  The OPT OUT feature can be found under the &#x201C;All Terms&#x201D; default view. The fee amount is $2 per fall and spring term, and is used to support the student leadership, involvement, governance, and advocacy programs managed by the California State Student Association (CSSA). For more information, see the <a href="http://www.csustudents.org/our-priorities/sirf/">CSSA website</a>.</p>
