<p>The California Education Code provides for the following nonresident tuition exemptions:  </p>


<ul>
<li><strong>Section 68075.7</strong> &#x2013; Nonresident students are exempt from paying nonresident tuition or any other fee that is exclusively applicable to nonresident students if they(1) reside in California, (2) meet the definition of &#x201C;covered individual&#x201D; as defined in subsection (c) of Section 3679 of Title 38 of the United States Code, as that provision read on July 1, 2015; and (3) are eligible for education benefits under either the federal Montgomery GI Bill-Active Duty program or the Post-9/11 GI Bill program.</li>
<li><strong>Section 68122</strong> Students who are victims of trafficking, domestic violence, and other serious crimes who have been granted T or U visa status are exempt from paying nonresident tuition if they (1) attended high school in California for three or more years; (2) graduated from a California high school or attained the equivalent; and (3) registered as an entering student or are currently enrolled at a CSU campus. </li>
<li><strong>Section 68130.5</strong> Students who are not residents of California are exempt from paying nonresident tuition if they (1) attended high school in California for three or more years; (2) graduated from a California high school or attained the equivalent; and (3) registered as an entering student or are currently enrolled at a CSU campus.
