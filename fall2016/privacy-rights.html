    <h1>Privacy Rights</h1>
    <p>The federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (20 U.S.C. 1232g) and regulations adopted thereunder (34 C.F.R. 99) set out requirements designed to protect students&apos; privacy in their records maintained by the campus. The statute and regulations govern access to certain student records maintained by the campus and the release of such records. The law provides that the campus must give students access to most records directly related to the student, and must also provide opportunity for a hearing to challenge the records if the student claims they are inaccurate, misleading or otherwise inappropriate. The right to a hearing under this law does not include any right to challenge the appropriateness of a grade determined by the instructor. The law generally requires the institution to receive a student&apos;s written consent before releasing personally identifiable data about the student.  </p>


<p>The institution has adopted a set of policies and procedures governing implementation of the statute and the regulations. Copies of these policies and procedures may be obtained from:  </p>


<p><strong>Office of the Provost</strong><br>Administrative Building<br>100 Campus Center<br>Seaside, <a href="/courses/json/ca-93955.json" class="course-link">CA 93955</a>-8001<br>831-582-5254<br><a href="mailto:provost@csumb.edu">provost@csumb.edu</a><br><a href="http://policy.csumb.edu/">http://policy.csumb.edu</a> </p>


<p>Among the types of information included in the campus statement of policies and procedures are: (1) the types of student records maintained and the information they contain; (2) the official responsible for maintaining each type of record; (3) the location of access lists indicating persons requesting or receiving information from the record; (4) policies for reviewing and expunging records; (5) student access rights to their records; (6) the procedures for challenging the content of student records; (7) the cost to be charged for reproducing copies of records; and (8) the right of the student to file a complaint with the Department of Education. The Department of Education has established an office and review board to investigate complaints and adjudicate violations. The designated office is:  </p>


<p><strong>Family Policy Compliance Office</strong><br>U.S. Department of Education<br>400 Maryland Ave, SW<br>Washington, <a href="/courses/json/dc-20202.json" class="course-link">DC 20202</a>-5920 </p>


<p>The campus is authorized under the Act to release directory information concerning students. Directory information may include the student&apos;s name, address, telephone listing, electronic mail address, photograph, date and place of birth, major field of study, participation in officially recognized activities and sports, weight and height of members of athletic teams, dates of attendance, grade level, enrollment status, degrees, honors, and awards received, and the most recent previous educational agency or institution attended by the student. The above-designated information is subject to release by the campus at any time unless the campus has received prior written objection from the student specifying what information the student requests not be released. Written objections should be sent to:  </p>


<p><strong>Office of the Registrar</strong><br>Student Service Building<br>100 Campus Center<br>Seaside, <a href="/courses/json/ca-93955.json" class="course-link">CA 93955</a>-8001<br>831-582-5100<br>Fax 831-582-3783<br><a href="mailto:records@csumb.edu?subject=">records@csumb.edu</a><br><a href="http://csumb.edu/records">CSUMB.EDU/records</a> </p>


<p>The campus is authorized to provide access to student records to campus officials and employees who have legitimate educational interests in such access. These persons have responsibilities in the campus&apos;s academic, administrative or service functions and have reason for accessing student records associated with their campus or other related academic responsibilities. Student records may also be disclosed to other persons or organizations under certain conditions (e.g. as part of accreditation or program evaluation; in response to a court order or subpoena; in connection with financial aid; or to other institutions to which the student is transferring).  </p>

      Selective Service

<p>The federal Military Selective Service Act (the &quot;Act&quot;) requires most males residing in the United States to present themselves for registration with the Selective Service System within thirty days of their eighteenth birthday. Most males between the ages of 18 and 25 must be registered. Males born after December 31, 1959, may be required to submit a statement of compliance with the Act and regulations in order to receive any grant, loan, or work assistance under specified provisions of existing federal law. In California, students subject to the Act who fail to register are also ineligible to receive any need-based student grants funded by the state or a public postsecondary institution.</p>
<p>Selective Service registration forms are available at any U.S. Post Office, and many high schools have a staff member or teacher appointed as a Selective Service Registrar. Applicants for financial aid can also request that information provided on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) be used to register them with the Selective Service. Information on the Selective Service System is available and the registration process may be initiated online at <a href="http://www.sss.gov/">http://www.sss.gov</a>.  </p>
