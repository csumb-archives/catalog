    <h1>Financial Aid</h1>
    <p>Financial aid funds come from a variety of sources, including federal, state, and private organizations and the university itself. With the exception of scholarships, all financial aid awards are based on financial need as determined by federal and state formulas.</p>
<p>The FAFSA website provides everything you need except the <strong>CSUMB code which is: 032603</strong>. Your completed FAFSA forms cannot be submitted before January 1. The priority financial aid application deadline date is March 2, however the Financial Aid Office recommends applying as soon after January 1 as possible.  </p>
