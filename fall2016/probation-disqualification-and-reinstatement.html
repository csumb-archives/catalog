      Academic Probation

</h3>

<p>An undergraduate student is placed on academic probation if at any time the cumulative grade point average in all college work or a cumulative grade point average at CSUMB falls below a C (2.0).  Students shall remain on academic probation until the cumulative and CSUMB grade point average is a C or until the student has been academically disqualified.  </p>


<p>A Graduate student, including one classified or conditionally classified, and credential-seeking is placed on academic probation if the cumulative grade point average at CSUMB falls below a B (2.0)<a href="http://csumb.edu/policy/matriculation-policy-graduate-credential-students"></a>.  </p>


<p>When such action is taken, the student shall be notified in writing and shall be provided with the conditions for removal from probation and the circumstances that would lead to disqualification, should probation not be removed.  </p>


<p>Some graduate programs have more rigorous standards requiring students to maintain a GPA of 3.0 or better in all courses. Students should consult an advisor to determine their obligation.  </p>

      Academic Disqualification
  <a class="anchor-link" href="#section-academic-disqualification"><span class="icon-link"></span></a>
</h3>

<p>Academic disqualification means that the student has not maintained satisfactory academic standards and is involuntarily separated from the university.  </p>


<p>Undergraduates on academic probation are subject to academic disqualification when:  </p>


<ul>
<li>As a freshman (fewer than 30 semester hours of college work completed) the student falls below a grade point average of 1.50 in all units attempted or in all units attempted at the campus where enrolled.</li>
<li>As a sophomore (30-59 semester hours of college work completed) the student falls below a grade point average of 1.70 in all units attempted or in all units attempted at the campus where enrolled.</li>
<li>As a junior (60-89 semester hours of college work completed) the student falls below a grade point average of 1.85 in all units attempted or in all units attempted at the campus where enrolled.</li>
<li>As a senior (90 or more semester hours of college work completed) the student falls below a grade point average of 1.95 in all units attempted or in all units attempted at the campus where enrolled.</li>
</ul>


<p>As authorized by Section 41300(c) of Title 5, undergraduates not on probation are subject to academic disqualification by the President or designee, when the following circumstances exist:  </p>


<ul>
<li>At the end of any term, the student has a cumulative grade point average below 1.0, and</li>
<li>The cumulative grade point average is so low that in view of the student&#x2019;s overall educational record, it seems unlikely that the deficiency will be removed within a reasonable period.</li>
</ul>


<p>Graduate or credential seeking students on academic probation are subject to Academic Disqualification when the student&apos;s cumulative GPA (or in applicable programs, when the student&apos;s course grades) at CSUMB is below a 3.0 for two consecutive terms.  </p>


<p>Students who have been disqualified shall be notified of the disqualification and of the right to petition the University for reinstatement.  </p>


<h3 id="section-notice-of-disqualification">
      Notice of Disqualification
  <a class="anchor-link" href="#section-notice-of-disqualification"><span class="icon-link"></span></a>
</h3>

<p>If you are disqualified at the end of an enrollment period under any of these provisions you will be notified before the beginning of the next consecutive regular enrollment period. </p>
<p>If you are disqualified at the beginning of a summer enrollment break you will be notified at least one month before the start of the fall term. In cases where you ordinarily would be disqualified at the end of a term, save for the fact that it is not possible to make timely notification, you may be advised that the disqualification is to be effective at the end of the next term. Such notification will include any conditions which, if met, would result in permission to continue in enrollment. </p>
<p>Failure to notify students does not create the right of a student to continue enrollment.  </p>


<h3 id="section-administrative-academic-probation">
      Administrative Academic Probation
  <a class="anchor-link" href="#section-administrative-academic-probation"><span class="icon-link"></span></a>
</h3>

<p>An undergraduate or graduate student may be placed on administrative academic probation by action of appropriate campus officials for any of the following reasons:  </p>


<ul>
<li>Withdrawal from all or a substantial portion of a program of studies in two successive terms or in any of three terms. Students whose withdrawal is directly associated with a chronic or recurring medical condition or its treatment are exempted.</li>
<li>Repeated failure to progress toward the stated degree objective or other program objective, including that resulting from assignment of 15 units of No Credit, when such failure appears to be due to circumstances within the control of the student.</li>
<li>Failure to comply, after due notice, with academic requirements or regulation, as defined by campus policy, which is routine for all students of a defined group of students (example: failure to complete a required practicum, failure to complete a specified number of units as a condition for receiving student financial aid or making satisfactory progress in the academic program).</li>
</ul>


<p>When such action is taken, the student shall be notified in writing and shall be provided with the conditions for removal from probation and the circumstances that would lead to disqualification, should probation not be removed.     </p>

      Administrative Academic Disqualification
  <a class="anchor-link" href="#section-administrative-academic-disqualification"><span class="icon-link"></span></a>
</h3>

<p>As authorized by Section 41300 of Title 5, the President may designate a campus official to act to disqualify a student not on probation when any one of the following circumstances exist:  </p>


<ul>
<li>The conditions for removal from administrative-academic probation are not met within the period specified.</li>
<li>The student becomes subject to academic probation while on administrative-academic probation.</li>
<li>The student becomes subject to administrative-academic probation for the same or similar reason for which he/she has been placed on administrative-academic probation previously, although not currently in such status.</li>
</ul>


<p>In addition, graduate students may be subject to academic-administrative disqualification if the following situations exist:  </p>


<ul>
<li>At the end of any term, the student has a cumulative grade point average below 2.5, and</li>
<li>The cumulative grade point average is so low that in view of the student&#x2019;s overall educational record, it seems unlikely that the deficiency will be removed within a reasonable period.</li>
</ul>


<p>When such action is taken, the student shall receive written notification including an explanation of the basis for the action.  </p>


<p>Moreover, a student who at any time during enrollment has demonstrated behavior so contrary to the standards of the profession for which the student is preparing as to render him/her unfit for the profession may be immediately disqualified and dis-enrolled from CSUMB. </p>
<p> The decision to disqualify a student under these terms shall be made by the appropriate dean in consultation with the Provost.  In such cases, the student shall be notified of his/her disqualification and the basis for the action taken by the appropriate university administrator.   </p>

      Reinstatement
  <a class="anchor-link" href="#section-reinstatement"><span class="icon-link"></span></a>
</h3>

<p>If disqualified, you are not eligible for reinstatement for a minimum of one academic year. You will be required to reapply for admission and submit a letter of appeal to the Office of Admissions. A committee will review your reinstatement appeal, with approval based upon your documented good-faith effort to improve academic standing and improve circumstances within your control that directly resulted in your disqualification. You will be informed in writing of your status within 30 days of receipt of your completed reinstatement petition. For information regarding reapplication and the petition process, call the Office of Admissions at 582-5100.  </p>

      Standards of Progress for Veterans
  <a class="anchor-link" href="#section-standards-of-progress-for-veterans"><span class="icon-link"></span></a>
</h3>

<p>If you are a veteran or an eligible dependent of a veteran receiving educational benefits and you remain on probation for a deficient cumulative grade point average below 2.0 beyond two semesters, your veteran&apos;s benefits will be discontinued and any further certification of benefits terminated.  </p>
