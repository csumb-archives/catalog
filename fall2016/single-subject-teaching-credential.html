    <h1>Single Subject Teaching Credential</h1>
    <p>We offer two alternatives for earning your single subject credential: traditional and internship. The traditional version of the single subject program offers opportunities for you to gain classroom experience through student teaching for the entire school year under the supervision of a cooperating teacher.</p>
<p>CSUMB&apos;s Single Subject Teaching Internship Program, in conjunction with the Monterey County Office of Education, gives you the opportunity to earn your credential while teaching. This option is directed toward students who have had significant experience teaching in schools prior to enrolling in the program. In the internship program, students are hired by local districts and assume full responsibility for teaching. If you qualify to enter the Single Subject program and are hired by an approved site, a teacher from your school will be selected as a mentor to help you through the internship experience.</p>
<p>Both credentialing alternatives are designed for individuals who are interested in teaching in linguistically and culturally diverse middle and high schools. Therefore, individuals obtain an English Learner Authorization (ELA). The ELA authorizes you to teach in settings where instruction is provided primarily through English.</p>

<p>Once you are admitted to the Single Subject program, you will be placed in the Student Teaching Pathway. After that, if you meet all of the requirements for an Intern Credential, you will move from the Student Teacher Pathway to the Internship Pathway.</p>
<p>If you enter the traditional, Student Teaching Pathway, you will be placed in a school for a minimum of four hours per day (usually from about 8:00-Noon) every day from the beginning to the end of the normal K-12 school year. If you have met all the requirements for an Intern Credential, including three required summer courses and a contracted teaching position with a local school district, you will be assigned to the Internship Pathway. In this case, you will teach the classes assigned to you by contract. All single subject academic classes are scheduled in the late afternoon/early evening and summers to accommodate those with full-time teaching obligations.</p>
<p>As our program prepares you to demonstrate successful beginning practice in teaching, you will satisfy the following California Standards for the Teaching Profession. You will prepare products in your courses that will be collected and kept on TK20, the computerized data management system used by the Department of Teacher Education. Reflective comments, a personal philosophy statement about teaching, observation reports of your teaching, and State-required Teacher Performance Assessments will be included as well. Your achievement of the California Standards for the Teaching Profession (CSTP) will be demonstrated through this computer-based collection.</p>
