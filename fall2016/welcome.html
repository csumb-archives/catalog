    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>Welcome to California State University, Monterey Bay. We are pleased to have you join us in your quest for higher education.</p>
<p>One of the youngest of the CSU campuses, Cal State Monterey Bay remains true to its founding vision as a &#x201C;model pluralistic academic community where all learn and teach one another in an atmosphere of mutual respect and pursuit of excellence.&#x201D; As our campus continues to grow, both in enrollment and in academic reputation, our faculty and staff remain committed to maintaining the personalized atmosphere that helps our students flourish.</p>
<p>Since its founding, our university has stressed the importance of community outreach and service learning. Cal State Monterey Bay has been recognized nationally for incorporating the concept of service learning throughout our curriculum, as we educate and graduate students who will move on to help strengthen the communities where they will live.</p>
<p>As you scan the course offerings in this catalog, you will see our university is comprehensive in scope. I encourage you to be open to new ideas as you determine where your interests lie. The residential campus experience provides an unmatched opportunity to expand horizons, share insights and learn from one another as you prepare to take your place in the world.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most useful lesson you can take from our campus is to learn how to learn. In preparing for a future of accelerating change, the most successful will be those whose formal educations serve as a cornerstone for a lifetime of learning.</p>
<p>At Cal State Monterey Bay, I hope you will be both challenged and inspired. The pursuit of a degree will not be easy, but it will be worthwhile.</p>
<p>All of us at CSUMB look forward to helping you along the way and celebrating your accomplishments.<br>Good luck and best wishes.</p>
<p>Eduardo M. Ochoa<br>President, Cal State Monterey Bay</p>
