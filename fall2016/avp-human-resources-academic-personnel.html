    <p>CSUMB became a higher education leader in integrating human resources functions for staff and academic personnel in October 2011.  Mary Roberts served in this dual role while wearing two hats and reporting to two separate vice presidents. To reap the full benefits of this unified approach for the entire university, President Ochoa combined the two titles and responsibilities and designated her as Associate Vice President for Human Resources and Academic Personnel effective June 2013, thus creating a single reporting line to the president of the university.</p>
<p>In this role, Mary leads a team effort in their commitment to provide excellent customer service to all campus community members regarding employment-related needs. Human Resources and Academic Personnel strive to attract, retain and support a diverse and quality workforce, and to develop innovative strategies to improve the effectiveness of the services we provide.</p>
<p>Mary joined the university in May 1995 as the Assistant Director of Human Resources and moved to the position of Director, then Assistant Vice President, in Academic Personnel beginning July 2001.</p>
<p>Prior to joining CSUMB, Mary had over 10 years of professional experience in human resources including positions at the Naval Postgraduate School and Defense Language Institute. Other experience in higher education includes supervisory experience at University of Florida and research experience in industrial/organizational psychology at Johns Hopkins University resulting in four publications.</p>
<p>Mary holds a master of arts degree in Psychology from Loyola University Maryland and a bachelor of arts degree from University of Maryland Baltimore County. She has several human resources related certifications to include Society for Human Resource Management, Mediator for Workplace Disputes and Employee Relations Law.  </p>
