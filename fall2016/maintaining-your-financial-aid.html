</h2>

<p>In order to maintain financial aid eligibility, you must make <strong>Satisfactory Academic Progress</strong> toward obtaining a degree. Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) will be monitored for all periods of enrollment whether or not you have received financial aid. The <a href="https://csumb.edu/fall2016/maintaining-your-financial-aid#minimum-standard-requirements">minimum standard requirements</a> are:   </p>


<ol>
<li>Maintaining a 2.0 GPA an an undergraduate student or a 3.0 GPA as a graduate student;</li>
<li>Meeting the unit completion requirements for your enrollment status; and,</li>
<li>Not exceeding the maximum time frame for your program.</li>
</ol>


<p>Students are evaluated on their <a href="/courses/json/sap-30.json" class="course-link">SAP 30</a> days after the start of the term. The first time a student fails to make satisfactory academic progress, they will be placed on <strong><a href="https://csumb.edu/fall2016/maintaining-your-financial-aid#financial-aid-warning">financial aid warning</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Students who do not meet minimum standard requirements at the end of their warning semester, will be placed on <strong><a href="https://csumb.edu/fall2016/maintaining-your-financial-aid#financial-aid-probation">financial aid probation</a></strong> for the next semester.  Also, any student who does not complete any units in a semester will be on <strong>financial aid probation</strong>.</p>
<p>Continued failure to meet the requirements will result in a loss of eligibility for future financial aid.  </p>

</h3>

<p>Title IV recipients who withdraw from CSUMB will be subject to repayment of a portion of awarded funds. Responsibility for repayment will be shared by CSUMB and the student</p>
<p>Financial Aid recipients who withdraw must repay any unearned portion of aid received for the term attended. The portion of unearned Title IV funds will be calculated by the Financial Aid office. The amount is based on the number of days completed, divided by the number of calendar days in the term. Breaks in enrollment of five or more consecutive calendar days are excluded from the number in the term. No repayment of Title IV funds will be required for withdrawals occurring after the 60% point of term. After determining the amounts of aid to be refunded or repaid, the funds must be distributed back to financial aid according to a specific order of priority prescribed in federal regulations. The order of distribution is federal loans; federal grants; and then other federal, state or institutional aid.</p>
<p>Registration fees will be fully refunded for courses dropped prior to the first day of instruction. Additional information is available upon request from the Financial Aid Office.</p>

  <a class="anchor-link" href="#section-unofficial-withdrawal"><span class="icon-link"></span></a>
</h3>

<p>If a student fails to earn a passing grade in at least one class, CSUMB is required to calculate the amount of Return to Title IV funds based on the last day of enrollment. If last day of attendance cannot be determined, CSUMB may use the midpoint of the period (in lieu of an official withdrawal date) as documentation of the student&apos;s last day of attendance. Unless the student can provide acceptable documentation that shows the student was enrolled more than 60 percent of the semester, the student will be responsible for returning unearned funds.
