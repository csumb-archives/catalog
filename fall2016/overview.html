</h2>

<p>The Board of Trustees, most of who are appointed by the governor and serve with faculty and student representatives, govern the system. The CSU Chancellor is the chief executive officer, reporting to the Board. The campus presidents serve as the campus-level chief executive officers. The Trustees, Chancellor, and Presidents develop systemwide educational policy. The Presidents, in consultation with the Academic Senate and other campus stakeholder groups, render and implement local policy decisions.  </p>

      CSU Historical Milestones
  <a class="anchor-link" href="#section-csu-historical-milestones"><span class="icon-link"></span></a>
</h2>

<p>   The Donahoe Higher Education Act established the individual California State Colleges as a system with a Board of Trustees and a Chancellor in 1960. In 1972, the system was designated as the California State University and Colleges, and in 1982 the system became the California State University. Today, the CSU is comprised of 23 campuses, including comprehensive and polytechnic universities and, since July 1995, the California Maritime Academy, a specialized campus.</p>
<p>The oldest campus&#x2014;San Jos&#xE9; State University&#x2014;was founded in 1857 and became the first institution of public higher education in California. The newest&#x2014;CSU Channel Islands&#x2014;opened in fall 2002, with freshmen arriving in fall 2003.</p>
<p>In 1963, the State Academic Senate was established to act as the official voice of CSU faculty in systemwide matters. Also, the California State College Student Presidents Association&#x2014;which was later renamed the California State Students Association&#x2014;was founded to represent each campus student association on issues affecting students.</p>
<p>Through its many decades of existence, the CSU has continued to adapt to address societal changes, student needs, and workforce trends. While the CSU&#x2019;s core mission has always focused on providing high-quality, affordable bachelor&#x2019;s and master&#x2019;s degree programs, over time the University has added a wide range of services and programs to support student success &#x2013; from adding health centers and special programs for veterans to building student residential facilities to provide a comprehensive educational experience.</p>
<p>To improve degree completion and accommodate students working full- or part-time, the educational paradigm expanded to give students the ability to complete upper-division and graduate requirements through part-time, late afternoon, and evening study. The University also expanded its programs to include a variety of teaching and school service credential programs, specially designed for working professionals.</p>
<p>The CSU marked another significant educational milestone when it broadened its degree offerings to include doctoral degrees. The CSU independently offers educational doctorate (Ed.D.), Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT), and Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) degree programs. A limited number of other doctoral degrees are offered jointly with the University of California and private institutions in California.</p>
<p>In an effort to accommodate community college transfer students, the CSU, in concert with the California Community Colleges, launched the Associate Degree for Transfer, which guarantees transfer students admission to the CSU with junior status for transfer students who earn the AA-T or AS-t degrees.</p>
<p>Always adapting to changes in technology and societal trends to support student learning and degree completion, the CSU initiated another milestone in 2013, when it launched Cal State Online, a systemwide collection of services that support the delivery of fully online programs from campuses. Now, full-time students also have access to fully online courses offered at other CSU campuses.</p>
<p>By providing an accessible, hands-on education that prepares graduates for career success, the CSU has created a network of alumni that is so extensive and renowned that it spans across the globe.  In 2014-15, the CSU celebrated The Class of 3 Million, the year-round campaign celebrating the 3 million alumni from all CSU&apos;s campuses, including the Class of 2015.</p>
<p>The CSU strives to continually develop innovative programs, services, and opportunities that will give students the tools they need to meet their full potential.  With 23 campuses, 470,000 students and 47,000 faculty and staff, the CSU is committed to providing a quality higher education that prepares students to become leaders in the changing workforce.  </p>
