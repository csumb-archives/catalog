<p>Class levels are the categories used to classify students on the basis of units completed. Freshmen are those who have completed fewer than 30 semester units. Students who have completed 30 to 59 semester units are considered sophomores. Juniors are those who have completed 60 to 89 semester units. Students who have completed 90 or more units have achieved senior status. Graduate students are those who have graduated with a bachelor&apos;s degree from an accredited college or university.  </p>

<p>As of July 1, 2011 federal law (Title 34, Code of Federal Regulations, sections 600.2 and 600.4) requires all accredited institutions to comply with the federal definition of the credit hour. For all CSU degree programs and courses bearing academic credit, the &#x201C;credit hour&#x201D; is defined as &#x201C;the amount of work represented in intended learning outcomes and verified by evidence of student achievement that is an institutionally established equivalency that reasonably approximates not less than:  </p>


<ol>
<li>One hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out-of-class student work each week for approximately fifteen weeks for one semester or trimester hour of credit, or ten to twelve weeks for one quarter hour of credit, or the equivalent amount of work over a different amount of time; or</li>
<li>At least an equivalent amount of work as required in paragraph (1) of this definition for other academic activities as established by the institution, including laboratory work, internships, practica, studio work, and other academic work leading to the award of credit hours.&#x201D;</li>
</ol>


<p>A credit hour is assumed to be a 50-minute period. In courses in which &#x201C;seat time&#x201D; does not apply, a credit hour may be measured by an equivalent amount of work, as demonstrated by student achievement.  </p>
