<p>The California State University does not discriminate on the basis of sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression or sexual orientation in its programs and activities, including admission and access. Federal and state laws, including Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, prohibit such discrimination toward students or applicants for admission.  Christine Erickson, Assistant Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students, has been designated to coordinate the efforts of CSUMB to comply with all applicable federal and state laws prohibiting discrimination on these bases. Inquiries concerning compliance may be presented to this person at cherickson@csumb.edu or (831) 582-4091.  The California State University is committed to providing equal opportunities to male and female CSU students in all campus programs, including intercollegiate athletics. </p>
<p>Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 protects all students regardless of their gender or gender identity from sex discrimination, which includes sexual harassment and violence:  </p>


<ul>
<li><strong>Sexual discrimination</strong> means an adverse act of sexual discrimination (including sexual harassment and sexual violence) that is perpetrated against an individual on a basis prohibited by Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. &#xA7;1681 et seq., and its implementing regulations, 34 C.F.R. Part 106 (Title IX); California Education Code &#xA7;66250 et seq., and/or California Government Code &#xA7;11135.</li>
<li><strong>Sexual harassment</strong> is unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that includes, but is not limited to, sexual violence, sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, indecent exposure and other verbal, nonverbal or physical unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature, where such conduct is sufficiently severe, persistent or pervasive that its effect, whether or not intended, could be considered by a reasonable person in the shoes of the individual, and is in fact considered by the individual, as limiting the individual&apos;s ability to participate in or benefit from the services, activities or opportunities offered by the university. Sexual harassment also includes gender-based harassment, which may include acts of verbal, non-verbal or physical aggression, intimidation or hostility based on sex or sex-stereotyping, even if those acts do not involve conduct of a sexual nature. </li>
<li><strong>Sexual violence</strong> means physical sexual acts (such as unwelcome sexual touching, sexual assault, sexual battery and rape) perpetrated against an individual without consent or against an individual who is incapable of giving consent due to that individual&apos;s use of drugs or alcohol, or disability.  </li>

<p>Title IX requires the university to designate a Title IX Coordinator to monitor and oversee overall Title IX compliance. Your campus Title IX Coordinator is available to explain and discuss your right to file a criminal complaint (for example, in cases of sexual assault); the university&#x2019;s complaint process, including the investigation process; how confidentiality is handled; available resources, both on and off campus; and other related matters. <strong><em>If you are in the midst of an emergency, please call the police immediately by dialing 9-1-1.</em></strong>    </p>

<p>Title IX requires the university to adopt and publish complaint procedures that provide for prompt and equitable resolution of sex discrimination complaints, including sexual harassment and violence.  CSU Executive Order 1074 (<a href="http://www.calstate.edu/eo/EO-1074.pdf">http://www.calstate.edu/eo/EO-1074.pdf</a>) is the systemwide procedure for all complaints of discrimination, harassment or retaliation <strong><em>made by students</em></strong> against the CSU, a CSU employee, other CSU students or a third party.  </p>
<p>Except in the case of a privilege recognized under California law (examples of which include Evidence Code &#xA7;&#xA7;1014 (psychotherapist-patient); 1035.8 (sexual assault counselor-victim); and 1037.5 (domestic violence counselor-victim), any member of the University community who knows of or has reason to know of sexual discrimination allegations involving students shall promptly inform the campus Title IX Coordinator.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether an alleged victim of sexual discrimination ultimately files a complaint, if the campus knows or has reason to know about possible sexual discrimination, harassment or violence, it must review the matter to determine if an investigation is warranted.  The campus must then take appropriate steps to eliminate any sex discrimination/harassment, prevent its recurrence, and remedy its effects.  </p>

      Safety of the Campus Community is Primary
  <a class="anchor-link" href="#section-safety-of-the-campus-community-is-primary"><span class="icon-link"></span></a>
</h3>

<p>The university&apos;s primary concern is the safety of its campus community members. The use of alcohol or drugs never makes the victim at fault for sexual discrimination, harassment or violence; therefore, victims should not be deterred from reporting incidents of sexual violence out of a concern that they might be disciplined for related violations of drug, alcohol or other university policies. Except in extreme circumstances, victims of sexual violence shall not be subject to discipline for related violations of the Student Conduct Code.  </p>

</h3>

<p>Individuals alleged to have committed sexual assault may face criminal prosecution by law enforcement and may incur penalties as a result of civil litigation.  In addition, employees and students may face discipline at the university.  Employees may face sanctions up to and including dismissal from employment, pursuant to established CSU policies and provisions of applicable collective bargaining unit agreements. </p>
<p>Students who are charged by the university with sexual discrimination, harassment or violence will be subject to discipline, pursuant to the California State University Student Conduct Procedures (see Executive Order 1073 at <a href="http://www.calstate.edu/eo/EO-1073.pdf">http://www.calstate.edu/eo/EO-1073.pdf</a> or any successor executive order) and will be subject to appropriate sanctions. In addition, during any investigation, the university may implement interim measures in order to maintain a safe and non-discriminatory educational environment. Such measures may include: immediate interim suspension from the university; a required move from university-owned or affiliated housing; adjustments to course schedule; and/or prohibition from contact with parties involved in the alleged incident.  </p>

</h2>

<p>CSUMB and its auxiliary organizations strive to maintain a working and learning environment free from sexual harassment. Sexual harassment may range from sexual innuendoes made at inappropriate times, perhaps in the guise of humor, to coerced sexual relations.</p>
<p>Sexual harassment occurs when unwelcome conduct is engaged in because of the targeted individual&#x2019;s sex, and:  </p>


<ol>
<li>Submission to such conduct is made, either explicitly or implicitly, a term or condition of an individual&apos;s employment or classroom achievement;</li>
<li>Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis or threatened to be used as the basis for employment, evaluations or grades; or</li>
<li>Such conduct is so severe or pervasive that its effect, whether or not intended, is an environment that could be considered by a reasonable person, and is in fact considered by the individual, as intimidating, hostile or offensive.</li>
</ol>


<p>Sexual harassment can be written (in print or electronically), verbal, visual or physical. Examples of harassment include:  </p>


<ul>
<li>Written communications, such as sending inappropriate jokes or comments in print or by e-mail;</li>
<li>Verbal communications, such as making graphic or degrading comments about an individual and/or his or her body or personal characteristics, or using epithets, derogatory comments or slurs;</li>
<li>Physical acts, such as unwanted touching, physical interference, or even assault;</li>
<li>Visual acts or displays, such as derogatory cartoons, drawings, or posters, or inappropriate gestures;</li>
<li>Making unwelcome sexual advances or propositions, or offering employment benefits or giving preferential treatment in exchange for sexual favors;</li>
<li>Making or threatening reprisals after a negative response to unwelcome conduct.</li>
</ul>


<p>&quot;Sex&quot; includes, but is not limited to: the victim&apos;s actual sex; the harasser&apos;s perception of the victim&apos;s sex; the harasser&apos;s perception of the victim&apos;s identity, appearance or behavior, whether or not that identity, appearance, or behavior is different from that traditionally associated with victim&apos;s sex at birth; and pregnancy, childbirth, or medical conditions related to pregnancy or childbirth.</p>
<p>To report sexual harassment as a student, contact:<br>Wendy Smith<br><a href="mailto:wensmith@csumb.edu">wensmith@csumb.edu</a><br>Title IX Coordinator<br>Dean of Students Office<br>831-582-3510  </p>

      Sexual Assault
  <a class="anchor-link" href="#section-sexual-assault"><span class="icon-link"></span></a>
</h3>

<p>CSUMB will not tolerate sexual assault in any form. CSUMB has adopted the state of California&apos;s definition of sexual assault to mean any involuntary sexual act in which a person is threatened, coerced, or forced to comply against his or her will and includes rape, acquaintance rape, date rape, and sexual battery. Sexual assault, which is a form of sexual harassment, is included in the definition of sex discrimination which is prohibited in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as amended and Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972 as amended. It is also governed by the California Penal Code (Sections 261 and 243.4) and Assembly Concurrent Resolution No. 46 (Resolution Chapter 105, passed into law on September 14, 1987).</p>
<p>Report sexual assault on campus to the University Police Department (UPD) immediately at 911 from any campus phone. Sexual assault is a form of sexual harassment and is also a violation of the criminal code. Thus, an individual reporting an allegation of sexual assault may initiate a criminal complaint, a discrimination complaint, or both, as the evidentiary standards and conclusions may differ. To file a criminal complaint, the reporting party should contact UPD at 911 (during the emergency) or 831-655-0268. To file a complaint of discrimination with the University as a student, the reporting party should contact the Deputy Title IX Coordinator at 831-582-3510.</p>
<p>Where there is probable cause to believe that a student, faculty, or staff member has violated the university&apos;s regulations prohibiting sexual assault, the university will actively pursue disciplinary action through appropriate investigation and legal channels. Even if criminal justice authorities choose not to prosecute, the university can pursue disciplinary action.</p>
<p>Regardless of the means selected for resolving allegations of discrimination and/or sexual harassment (including sexual assault), the initiation of a complaint will not cause any negative reflection on the complainant, nor will it affect such person&#x2019;s future business dealings with the university, his or her employment, compensation or work assignments or, in the case of students, grades, class selection or other matters pertaining to his or her status as a student at the university. Every effort should be made to resolve any incident as soon as possible while the facts and potential testimony of witnesses, if any, are current.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the university that retaliation against complainants is prohibited. The university acts vigorously to prevent any retaliation being taken against those initiating inquiries or filing complaints; retaliation constitutes separate grounds for filing a complaint with these procedures and for potential disciplinary action against the alleged violator.  </p>

<p>Smoking is not permitted anywhere in the residence halls. This includes individual rooms.</p>
<p>Smoking is permitted outdoors in areas that are at least 25 feet away from a main exit, entrance, or operable window of a public building.</p>

</h3>

<ol>
<li>Standards for Student Conduct  </li>
</ol>


<p>(a) Campus Community Values  </p>


<p>The university is committed to maintaining a safe and healthy living and learning environment for students, faculty, and staff.  Each member of the campus community should choose behaviors that contribute toward this end.  Students are expected to be good citizens and to engage in responsible behaviors that reflect well upon their university, to be civil to one another and to others in the campus community, and contribute positively to student and university life.  </p>


<p>(b) Grounds for Student Discipline  </p>


<p>Student behavior that is not consistent with the Student Conduct Code is addressed through an educational process that is designed to promote safety and good citizenship and, when necessary, impose appropriate consequences.  </p>


<p>The following are the rounds upon which student discipline can be based: </p>
<p>(1) Dishonesty, including: </p>
<p>(A) Cheating, plagiarism, or other forms of academic dishonesty that are intended to gain unfair academic advantage.<br>(B) Furnishing false information to a university official, faculty member, or campus office.<br>(C) Forgery, alteration, or misuse of a university document, key, or identification instrument.<br>(D) Misrepresenting oneself to be an authorized agent of the university or one of its auxiliaries. </p>
<p>(2) Unauthorized entry into, presence in, use of, or misuse of university property. </p>
<p>(3) Willful, material and substantial disruption or obstruction of a university-related activity, or any on-campus activity. </p>
<p>(4) Participating in an activity that substantially and materially disrupts the normal operations of the university, or infringes on the rights of members of the university community. </p>
<p>(5) Willful, material, and substantial obstruction of the free flow of pedestrian or other traffic, on or leading to campus property or an off-campus university related activity. </p>
<p>(6) Disorderly, lewd, indecent, or obscene behavior at a university related activity, or directed toward a member of the university community. </p>
<p>(7) Conduct that threatens or endangers the health or safety of any person within or related to the university community, including physical abuse, threats, intimidation, harassment, or sexual misconduct. </p>
<p>(8) Hazing, or conspiracy to haze. Hazing is defined as any method of initiation or pre-initiation into a student organization or student body, whether or not the organization or body is officially recognized by an educational institution, which is likely to cause serious bodily injury to any former, current, or prospective student of any school, community college, college, university or other educational institution in this state (Penal Code 245.6), and in addition, any act likely to cause physical harm, personal degradation or disgrace resulting in physical or mental harm, to any former, current, or prospective student of any school, community college, college, university or other educational institution. The term &quot;hazing&quot; does not include customary athletic events or school sanctioned events. </p>
<p>Neither the express or implied consent of a victim of hazing, nor the lack of active participation in a particular hazing incident is a defense. Apathy or acquiescence in the presence of hazing is not a neutral act, and is also a violation of this section. </p>
<p>(9) Use, possession, manufacture, or distribution of illegal drugs or drug-related paraphernalia, (except as expressly permitted by law and university regulations) or the misuse of legal pharmaceutical drugs. </p>
<p>(10) Use, possession, manufacture, or distribution of alcoholic beverages (except as expressly permitted by law and university regulations), or public intoxication while on campus or at a university related activity. </p>
<p>(11) Theft of property or services from the university community, or misappropriation of university resources. </p>
<p>(12) Unauthorized destruction, or damage to university property or other property in the university community. </p>
<p>(13) Possession or misuse of firearms or guns, replicas, ammunition, explosives, fireworks, knives, other weapons, or dangerous chemicals (without the prior authorization of the campus president) on campus or at a university related activity. </p>
<p>(14) Unauthorized recording, dissemination, or publication of academic presentations (including handwritten notes) for a commercial purpose. </p>
<p>(15) Misuse of computer facilities or resources, including: </p>
<p>(A) Unauthorized entry into a file, for any purpose. </p>
<p>(B) Unauthorized transfer of a file. </p>
<p>(C) Use of another&apos;s identification or password. </p>
<p>(D) Use of computing facilities, campus network, or other resources to interfere with the work of another member of the university community. </p>
<p>(E) Use of computing facilities and resources to send obscene or intimidating and abusive messages. </p>
<p>(F) Use of computing facilities and resources to interfere with normal university operations. </p>
<p>(G) Use of computing facilities and resources in violation of copyright laws. </p>
<p>(H) Violation of a campus computer use policy. </p>
<p>(16) Violation of any published university policy, rule, regulation, or presidential order. </p>
<p>(17) Failure to comply with directions of, or interference with, any university official or any public safety officer while acting in the performance of duties.</p>
<p>(18) Any act chargeable as a violation of a federal, state, or local law that poses a substantial threat to the safety or wellbeing of members of the university community or to property within the university community, or that poses a significant threat of disruption or interference with university operations. </p>
<p>(19) Violation of the Student Conduct Procedures, including: </p>
<p>(A) Falsification, distortion, or misrepresentation of information related to a student discipline matter. </p>
<p>(B) Disruption or interference with the orderly progress of a student discipline proceeding. </p>
<p>(C) Initiation of a student discipline proceeding in bad faith. </p>
<p>(D) Attempting to discourage another from participating in the student discipline matter. </p>
<p>(E) Attempting to influence the impartiality of any participant in a student discipline matter. </p>
<p>(F) Verbal or physical harassment or intimidation of any participant in a student discipline matter. </p>
<p>(G) Failure to comply with the sanction(s) imposed under a student discipline proceeding.</p>
<p>(20) Encouraging, permitting, or assisting another to do any act that could subject him or her to discipline.  </p>


<p>(c) Application of this Code  </p>


<p>Sanctions for the conduct listed above can be imposed on applicants, enrolled students, students between academic terms, graduates awaiting degrees, and students who withdraw from school while a disciplinary matter is pending. Conduct that threatens the safety or security of the campus community, or substantially disrupts the functions or operation of the university is within the jurisdiction of this article regardless of whether it occurs on or off campus. Nothing in this code may conflict with Education Code section 66301 that prohibits disciplinary action against students based on behavior protected by the First Amendment.  </p>


<p>(d) Procedures for Enforcing this Code  </p>


<p>The chancellor shall adopt procedures to ensure students are afforded appropriate notice and an opportunity to be heard before the university imposes any sanction for a violation of the Student Conduct Code.  </p>


<p>(e) Civil and Criminal Penalties for violation of Federal Copyrights Law  </p>


<p>Anyone who is found to be liable for copyright infringement may be ordered to pay either actual damages or &#x201C;statutory&#x201D; damages between $750 and $30,000 per work infringed. In the case of a &#x201C;willful&#x201D; infringement, a court may award up to $150,000 per work infringed. Courts also have discretion to award costs and attorneys&#x2019; fees to the prevailing party. (See 17 U.S.C. &#xA7;&#xA7;504 and 505.) Willful copyright infringement can also result in criminal penalties, including imprisonment of up to five years and fines of up to $250,000 per offense. (See 17 U.S.C. &#xA7;506 and 18 U.S.C. &#xA7;2319.)  </p>


<ol>
<li>Disposition of Fees: Campus Emergency; Interim Suspension.  </li>
</ol>


<p>The president of the campus may place on probation, suspend, or expel a student for one or more of the causes enumerated in Section 41301. No fees or tuition paid by or for such student for the semester, quarter, or summer session in which he or she is suspended or expelled shall be refunded. If the student is readmitted before the close of the semester, quarter, or summer session in which he or she is suspended, no additional tuition or fees shall be required of the student on account of the suspension.  </p>


<p>During periods of campus emergency, as determined by the president of the individual campus, the president may, after consultation with the chancellor, place into immediate effect any emergency regulations, procedures, and other measures deemed necessary or appropriate to meet the emergency, safeguard persons and property, and maintain educational activities.  </p>


<p>The president may immediately impose an interim suspension in all cases in which there is reasonable cause to believe that such an immediate suspension is required in order to protect lives or property and to insure the maintenance of order. A student so placed on interim suspension shall be given prompt notice of charges and the opportunity for a hearing within 10 days of the imposition of interim suspension. During the period of interim suspension, the student shall not, without prior written permission of the president or designated representative, enter any campus of the California State University other than to attend the hearing. Violation of any condition of interim suspension shall be grounds for expulsion.  </p>


<p><strong>Enforcement Process</strong>  </p>


<p>The Judicial Affairs officer represents the university community&apos;s interests during the enforcement process. The Judicial Affairs officer is empowered to investigate the allegations against the student, to decide whether or not sufficient evidence exists to file a complaint, and to represent CSUMB at the hearing.  </p>


<p>The Judicial Affairs officer and other members of the university community may also work with students to resolve the issues in question before a hearing becomes necessary. Detailed information about student conduct policies and procedures is available on the <a href="http://CSUMB.EDU/judicial">CSUMB.EDU/judicial</a> website.  </p>
