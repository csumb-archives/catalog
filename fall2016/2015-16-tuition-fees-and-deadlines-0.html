    <h1>2015-16 Tuition, Fees, and Deadlines</h1>
    <p>The CSU makes every effort to keep student costs to a minimum. Fees listed in published schedules or student accounts may need to be increased when public funding is inadequate. Therefore, CSU must reserve the right, even after initial tuition and fee payments are made, to increase or modify any listed tuition and fees, without notice, until the date when instruction for a particular semester or quarter has begun. All CSU listed tuition and fees should be regarded as <strong>estimates</strong> that are subject to change upon approval by the Board of Trustees.</p>
<p>The following reflects applicable systemwide fees for semester campuses that were authorized by the Board of Trustees at their July and November 2011 meetings and September 2012 meeting. <em><strong>These rates are subject to change.</strong></em>  </p>

      Fee Allocation
  <a class="anchor-link" href="#section-fee-allocation"><span class="icon-link"></span></a>
</h4>

<p>A fee advisory committee comprised of a student majority provides advice to the campus president about charging student fees and allocating campus-based fee revenue. Resources from the materials, services, and facilities fee are used to support a variety of services, and currently are allocated to support health services, instructionally related activities, transportation, childcare, and university services (includes ID card, transcripts, campus catalog, graduation/diploma). The allocation to transportation supports alternative modes of transportation, including the shuttle service, but does not include a parking permit. If you elect to purchase a parking permit, you will pay an additional fee as noted in Other Fees and Charges.  </p>
