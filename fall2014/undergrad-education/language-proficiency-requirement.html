<p>The ability to use a language other than English to communicate, interpret, and present information is essential for success in the 21st century.&#xA0; It demonstrates that you can be flexible in difficult situations and adaptable in new environments.&#xA0; It also shows that you have the capacity to see the world through multiple perspectives.</p>
<p>Through the language learning experience, you will expand your understanding of the world and what it means to be a global citizen, giving you the confidence to take on new challenges in a collaborative environment.</p>
<p>Meeting the CSUMB Language Proficiency Requirement enables you to communicate with culturally appropriate manners at an intermediate level in your language of study, with basic knowledge of cultural customs, practices, products and perspectives on familiar topics; and to be able to meaningfully compare your own culture with other languages and cultures.</p>
