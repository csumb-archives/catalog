<p><a href="../undergrad-education/general-education/d2-us-histories-democratic-participation/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>American Institutions</strong></a><br>The CSU requires each student receiving a baccalaureate degree to be knowledgeable about the Constitution of the United States, American history, and state and local government.&#xA0; Courses fulfilling this requirement are identified in the catalog, and will also meet an Area D GE requirement.</p>

<p><a href="../undergrad-education/language-proficiency-requirement/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Language Proficiency Requirement</strong></a><br>Students are assumed to begin language study at the 102 level and are required to demonstrate proficiency through the 201 (intermediate) level.&#xA0; Four units of language will count toward Area C GE units.&#xA0; Students transferring into and graduating from an approved high-unit major who are either A-E Complete or who have 60+ units are exempted.&#xA0; Students should consult their advisor for more information.</p>
<h5>Upper Division</h5>
<hr>
<p><a href="../undergrad-education/general-education/d4-upper-division-service-learning/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Upper Division Service Learning</strong></a><br>Courses fulfilling this requirement must be taken no sooner than the term in which the student achieves upper division status (60+ units).&#xA0; UDSL courses offer 2 units of upper division GE in Area D, and also offer additional units counting toward another GE area or the major.</p>
<p><a href="../undergrad-education/a4-oral-written-communication-critical-thinking-and-ethics-gwar/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Graduate Writing Assessment Requirement</strong></a><br>Many courses on campus satisfy the GWAR.&#xA0; Students should consult with their academic advisor, as some GWAR-approved courses also meet major requirements.</p>
<hr>
<h4>Major Requirements</h4>
<p>The State of California requires students to complete a minimum of 24 units in their major program of study (36 units for a BS).&#xA0; These units are earned through successful completion of required courses, outcomes, and experiences.&#xA0; Students should reference the University Catalog to identify specific program requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Major Learning Outcomes</strong><br>All CSUMB major degree programs have a set of learning outcomes that students must satisfy through aligned courses or alternate assessments, as designed by the program.&#xA0; The University Catalog lists the MLOs for each degree program.</p>
<p><strong>Concentrations</strong><br>Many degree programs require students to select a particular area of study within the major in order to attain greater depth of knowledge and understanding.&#xA0; The University Catalog will indicate the options available to students.</p>
<hr>
<h4>Free Electives</h4>
<p>The State of California requires a minimum of 120 semester units to be eligible for a baccalaureate degree. Students who complete general education and major requirements in fewer than 120 semester units are able to select additional courses as needed to meet the state requirement.</p>
