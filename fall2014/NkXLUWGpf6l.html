<p><strong>Disability</strong></p>
<p>The California State University does not discriminate on the basis of disability in its programs and activities, including admission and access. Federal and state laws, including sections 504 and 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, prohibit such discrimination.&#xA0;Christine Erikson, Assistant Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students,&#xA0;has been designated to coordinate the efforts of CSUMB to comply with all applicable federal and state laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of disability toward students or applicants admission.&#xA0; Inquiries concerning compliance may be presented to this person at&#xA0;cherickson@csumb.edu or&#xA0;(831) 582-4091<em>.</em></p>
<p><em>&#xA0;</em><strong>Sex/Gender/Gender Identity/Gender Expression/Sexual Orientation</strong></p>
<p>The California State University does not discriminate on the basis of sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression or sexual orientation in its programs and activities, including admission and access. Federal and state laws, including Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, prohibit such discrimination toward students or applicants for admission.&#xA0; Christine Erikson, Assistant Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students,&#xA0;has been designated to coordinate the efforts of CSUMB<em>&#xA0;</em>to comply with all applicable federal and state laws prohibiting discrimination on these bases. Inquiries concerning compliance may be presented to this person at&#xA0;cherickson@csumb.edu or&#xA0;(831) 582-4091.&#xA0; The California State University is committed to providing equal opportunities to male and female CSU students in all campus programs, including intercollegiate athletics.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 protects all students regardless of their gender or gender identity from sex discrimination, which includes sexual harassment and violence:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sexual discrimination</strong> means an adverse act of sexual discrimination (including sexual harassment and sexual violence) that is perpetrated against an individual on a basis prohibited by Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. &#xA7;1681 et seq., and its implementing regulations, 34 C.F.R. Part 106 (Title IX); California Education Code &#xA7;66250 et seq., and/or California Government Code &#xA7;11135.</li>
<li><strong>Sexual harassment</strong> is unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that includes, but is not limited to, sexual violence, sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, indecent exposure and other verbal, nonverbal or physical unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature, where such conduct is sufficiently severe, persistent or pervasive that its effect, whether or not intended, could be considered by a reasonable person in the shoes of the individual, and is in fact considered by the individual, as limiting the individual&apos;s ability to participate in or benefit from the services, activities or opportunities offered by the university. Sexual harassment also includes gender-based harassment, which may include acts of verbal, non-verbal or physical aggression, intimidation or hostility based on sex or sex-stereotyping, even if those acts do not involve conduct of a sexual nature.&#xA0;</li>
<li><strong>Sexual violence</strong> means physical sexual acts (such as unwelcome sexual touching, sexual assault, sexual battery and rape) perpetrated against an individual without consent or against an individual who is incapable of giving consent due to that individual&apos;s use of drugs or alcohol, or disability. &#xA0;</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Whom to Contact If You Have Complaints, Questions or Concerns</strong></p>
<p>Title IX requires the university to designate a Title IX Coordinator to monitor and oversee overall Title IX compliance. Your campus Title IX Coordinator is available to explain and discuss your right to file a criminal complaint (for example, in cases of sexual assault); the university&#x2019;s complaint process, including the investigation process; how confidentiality is handled; available resources, both on and off campus; and other related matters. <strong><em>If you are in the midst of an emergency, please call the police immediately by dialing 9-1-1.</em></strong> &#xA0;</p>
<p><span><strong>Campus Deputy Title IX Coordinator:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Anna Bartkowski</li>
<li>abartkowski@csumb.edu</li>
<li>(831) 582-3510</li>
<li>M-F, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.</li>
</ul>

<li>(800) 421-3481 or<span> <a href="mailto:ocr@ed.gov" rel="nofollow"><span>ocr@ed.gov</span></a></span></li>
<li>If you wish to fill out a complaint form online with the OCR, you may do so at:<span> <a href="http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/complaintintro.html" rel="nofollow"><span>http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/complaintintro.html</span></a>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Title IX requires the university to adopt and publish complaint procedures that provide for prompt and equitable resolution of sex discrimination complaints, including sexual harassment and violence.&#xA0; CSU Executive Order 1074 <span>(<a href="http://www.calstate.edu/eo/EO-1074.pdf" rel="nofollow"><span>http://www.calstate.edu/eo/EO-1074.pdf</span></a>) </span>is the systemwide procedure for all complaints of discrimination, harassment or retaliation <strong><em>made by students</em></strong> against the CSU, a CSU employee, other CSU students or a third party. &#xA0;</p>
<p>Except in the case of a privilege recognized under California law (examples of which include Evidence Code &#xA7;&#xA7;1014 (psychotherapist-patient); 1035.8 (sexual assault counselor-victim); and 1037.5 (domestic violence counselor-victim), any member of the University community who knows of or has reason to know of sexual discrimination allegations involving students shall promptly inform the campus Title IX Coordinator.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether an alleged victim of sexual discrimination ultimately files a complaint, if the campus knows or has reason to know about possible sexual discrimination, harassment or violence, it must review the matter to determine if an investigation is warranted.&#xA0; The campus must then take appropriate steps to eliminate any sex discrimination/harassment, prevent its recurrence, and remedy its effects.</p>
<p><strong>Safety of the Campus Community is Primary</strong></p>
<p>The university&apos;s primary concern is the safety of its campus community members. The use of alcohol or drugs never makes the victim at fault for sexual discrimination, harassment or violence; therefore, victims should not be deterred from reporting incidents of sexual violence out of a concern that they might be disciplined for related violations of drug, alcohol or other university policies. Except in extreme circumstances, victims of sexual violence shall not be subject to discipline for related violations of the Student Conduct Code.</p>
<p><strong>Information Regarding Campus, Criminal and Civil Consequences of Committing Acts of Sexual Violence</strong></p>
<p>Individuals alleged to have committed sexual assault may face criminal prosecution by law enforcement and may incur penalties as a result of civil litigation.&#xA0; In addition, employees and students may face discipline at the university.&#xA0; Employees may face sanctions up to and including dismissal from employment, pursuant to established CSU policies and provisions of applicable collective bargaining unit agreements.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Students who are charged by the university with sexual discrimination, harassment or violence will be subject to discipline, pursuant to the California State University Student Conduct Procedures (see Executive Order 1073 at <a href="http://www.calstate.edu/eo/EO-1073.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.calstate.edu/eo/EO-1073.pdf</a> or any successor executive order) and will be subject to appropriate sanctions. In addition, during any investigation, the university may implement interim measures in order to maintain a safe and non-discriminatory educational environment. Such measures may include: immediate interim suspension from the university; a required move from university-owned or affiliated housing; adjustments to course schedule; and/or prohibition from contact with parties involved in the alleged incident.</p>
