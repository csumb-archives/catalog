  	    <span class="print-link"></span> <p>Applicants will be selected for admission from among those who meet the following requirements. As we consider your application, our credential program committee will look at your coursework with an eye toward breadth of subject matter and overall demonstration of academic ability. In addition to the requirements listed, experience with 6-12 grade students from diverse backgrounds, display of personal and academic qualities that will enhance teaching success, and proficiency in a second language that is in demand in California schools are considered important.</p>
<ol>
<li>A complete application to CSUMB, including required fees and supporting materials.</li>
<li>A complete supplementary application to the Single Subject Credential Program, including supporting materials. Please apply on-line by going directly to our website at <a href="http://teach.csumb.edu/apply-now" rel="nofollow">teach.csumb.edu/apply-now</a>.</li>
<li>All of our applicants must have been awarded a bachelor&apos;s degree from an accredited institution of higher education. The transcript from the college where you received your bachelor&apos;s degree will note your degree and the date you received it.</li>
<li>GPA Requirement: Refer to the program website for more information.</li>
<li>Proof of having taken all of the California Basic Educational Skills Test (CBEST).&#xA0; See <a href="http://www.ctcexams.nesinc.com" title="www.ctcexams.nesinc.com" rel="nofollow">www.ctcexams.nesinc.com</a>.</li>
<li>A course that includes study of the U.S. Constitution.</li>
<li>Three semester units or the equivalent of a single language other than English.</li>
<li>Three letters of recommendation by those who have observed you teaching or working with culturally diverse adolescents or youth.</li>
<li>Proof of subject matter competence in the area you intend to teach (English, social science, math, science or foreign language). In order to earn a Single Subject Teaching Credential, it is necessary to verify your subject matter competence as part of your teaching ability. You may do so in one of the following ways:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>By completing a subject matter preparation program. Only programs that have been evaluated and approved by the Commission on Teacher Credentialing fulfill this requirement. In this case, you will submit an original copy of a verification letter from a California college or university that offers such a program. CSUMB currently offers approved (<em>waiver</em>) programs in English and Math. If you graduated from another California institution, check with its teacher education program to see if they offer an approved (<em>waiver</em>) program in your subject area.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>By passing the appropriate state-required CSET examinations in the subject area. It is crucial that you contact the CSUMB Single Subject Program office as soon as possible for information and advisement about fulfilling this requirement. Test dates, descriptions, and registration materials are available at <a href="http://www.ctcexams.nesinc.com" title="www.ctcexams.nesinc.com" rel="nofollow">www.ctcexams.nesinc.com</a>.</li>
