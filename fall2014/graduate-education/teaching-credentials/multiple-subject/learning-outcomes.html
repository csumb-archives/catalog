<p>The philosophy and purposes of all educator preparation programs at CSUMB are evidenced in outcome skills, knowledge and dispositions in our teacher candidates as they complete their programs. Our candidates demonstrate effective teaching practices in multicultural, pluralistic settings as they seek to contribute to a socially just society. Our curricula are all outcomes-based, and result in the achievement of program standards.</p>
<h6>Skill and Knowledge Outcomes</h6>
<p>All credential programs are based on the California Standards for the Teaching Professions (CSTPs). Our expectations are outcome behaviors, knowledge and skills directly related to the effective teaching practices embodied in the standards. The CSTPs are restated here as a major portion of the outcomes of all credential programs.</p>
<p><strong>Standard 1: Engaging and Supporting All Students in Learning</strong></p>
<p><strong>Standard 2: Creating and Maintaining Effective Environments for Student Learning</strong></p>
<p><strong>Standard 3: Understanding and Organizing Subject Matter for Student Learning</strong></p>
<p><strong>Standard 4: Planning Instruction and Designing Learning Experiences for All Students</strong></p>
<p><strong>Standard 5: Assessing Students for Learning</strong></p>
<p><strong>Standard 6: Developing as a Professional Educator</strong></p>
<p>The following additional program learning outcome has been described for our CSUMB credential programs:</p>
<p><strong>LO 7 Planning and implementing an inclusive, multicultural and assets-based curriculum</strong></p>
<p>Individuals demonstrate these outcomes in course settings and in field experiences through measures that are integrated with the curriculum. As our program prepares one to demonstrate successful beginning practice in teaching, individuals satisfy the CSTPs by successfully completing all of the courses listed, and by developing and demonstrating appropriate beginning teacher skills in field placement. As required by the state legislature, individuals will also demonstrate adequate attainment of the CSTPs by completing a Teaching Performance Assessment. CSUMB&apos;s credential programs use the Performance Assessment for California Teachers (PACT) for this purpose.</p>
<h6>Dispositional Outcomes</h6>
<p>The Teacher Education Department has adopted a set of professional dispositions that are to be demonstrated by teacher candidates as part of the requirements for program completion. These dispositions include the following.</p>
<p><strong>Professional educators are committed to ethical conduct: fairness, honesty, respect, responsibility, compassion, collaboration and collegiality.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Professional educators believe all students can and will experience academic success.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Professional educators believe individual differences in learners are assets to be accommodated in the classroom.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Professional educators are inclined towards being advocates who identify and strive to eliminate inequities, social injustice and prejudice as stewards of public education for a just society.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Professional educators reflect on their own practices in a process that leads to continual improvement.</strong></p>
<p>The means for conveying professional dispositions and evaluating teacher candidates achievement include course assignments; instructional plans; applied assessments; field experiences and other practical training; observed teaching practices and other interactions with students in a classroom; reflection assignments and self-evaluation.</p>
