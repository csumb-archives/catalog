<p><strong>&#xA0;More than 50-year tradition of excellence</strong></p>
<p>&#xA0;Academic excellence has been achieved by the CSU through a distinguished faculty whose primary responsibility is superior teaching. While each campus is unique based on its curricular specialties, location and campus culture, every CSU is distinguished for the quality of its educational programs. All campuses are fully accredited, provide a high-quality broad liberal educational program and offer opportunities for students to engage in campus life through the Associated Students, Inc., clubs and service learning. Through extensive industry partnerships and robust campus auxiliaries, the CSU is expanding programs, internships and workforce training opportunities to ensure CSU students are ready with the critical thinking skills, industry knowledge and hands-on experience for employment and career advancement.</p>

<p><strong>Governance</strong></p>
<p>The system is governed by the Board of Trustees, most of whom are appointed by the governor and serve with faculty and student representatives. The CSU Chancellor is the chief executive officer, reporting to the Board. The campus presidents serve as the campus-level chief executive officers. The Trustees, Chancellor and presidents develop systemwide educational policy. The presidents, in consultation with the Academic Senate and other campus stakeholder groups, render and implement local policy decisions.</p>
<p><strong>CSU Historical Milestones</strong></p>
<p>The individual California State Colleges was established as a system with a Board of Trustees and a Chancellor in 1960 by the Donahoe Higher Education Act. In 1972, the system was designated as the California State University and Colleges, and in 1982 the system became the California State University (CSU). Today, the CSU is comprised of 23 campuses, including comprehensive and polytechnic universities and, since July 1995, the California Maritime Academy, a specialized campus.</p>
<p>The oldest campus&#x2014;San Jos&#xE9; State University&#x2014;was founded in 1857 and became the first institution of public higher education in California. The newest&#x2014;CSU Channel Islands&#x2014;opened in fall 2002, with freshmen arriving in fall 2003.</p>
<p>In 1963, the State Academic Senate was established to act as the official voice of CSU faculty in systemwide matters. Also, the California State College Student Presidents Association&#x2014;which was later renamed the California State Students Association&#x2014;was founded to represent each campus student association on issues affecting students.</p>
<p>Through its many decades of existence, the CSU has continued to adapt to address societal changes, student needs and workforce trends. While the CSU&#x2019;s core mission has always focused on providing high-quality, affordable bachelor&#x2019;s and master&#x2019;s degree programs, over time the university has added a wide range of services and programs to support student success &#x2013; from adding health centers and special programs for veterans to building student residential facilities to provide a comprehensive educational experience.</p>
<p>To improve degree completion and accommodate students working full- or part-time, the educational paradigm expanded to give students the ability to complete upper-division and graduate requirements through part-time, late afternoon, and evening study. The university also expanded its programs to include a variety of teaching and school service credential programs, specially designed for working professionals.</p>
<p>The CSU marked another significant educational milestone when it broadened its degree offerings to include doctoral degrees. The CSU independently offers educational doctorate (Ed.D.), Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT), and Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) degree programs. A limited number of other doctoral degrees are offered jointly with the University of California and private institutions in California.</p>
<p>In 2010, in an effort to accommodate community college transfer students, the university, in concert with the California Community Colleges, launched the Associate Degree for Transfer, which guarantees transfer students admission to the CSU with junior status.</p>
<p>Always adapting to changes in technology and societal trends to support student learning and degree completion, the CSU initiated another milestone in 2013, when it launched Cal State Online, a systemwide collection of services that support the delivery of fully online programs from campuses. Now, full-time students also have access to fully online courses offered at other CSU campuses.</p>
<p>The CSU is dynamic and ever changing to ensure a quality higher education to the students of California. With 23 campuses, 437,000 students and 44,000 faculty and staff, the CSU plays a critical role in preparing outstanding candidates for the job market. The CSU is committed to continually developing innovative programs, services and opportunities that will give students the tools they need to meet their full potential.</p>
