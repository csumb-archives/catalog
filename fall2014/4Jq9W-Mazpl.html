  	    <span class="print-link"></span> <p>Your education is not just about you and your future career. It is also about enabling you to contribute to your community and play a part in bettering the world. Consequently, the service learning program at CSUMB offers you the opportunity to be involved in real-world community issues as part of your academic program, so that you can learn about service and social responsibility as a core part of your education.</p>
<p>Service learning combines formal coursework with thoughtfully organized community service experiences that teach about diversity, compassion, justice and social responsibility. Service learning courses address community-identified needs while helping students meet academic, social and civic learning goals. At CSUMB, service learning helps students develop the knowledge, skills and attitudes necessary to be <em><a href="http://service.csumb.edu/fundamentals" rel="nofollow"><em>multicultural</em> community builders</a>.</em></p>
<p>Through service, guided self-reflection, readings and in class discussions students learn about themselves and their relationship to the community around them. Service learning allows students to engage with real-world issues and social problems, and to work with community organizations to become &quot;part of the solution.&quot;</p>
<p>CSUMB is one of the few public universities in the country where service learning is a graduation requirement. Each semester,&#xA0;<strong>over one thousand CSUMB students</strong>&#xA0;are working in the community at over two hundred local schools, community organizations and governmental agencies.</p>
