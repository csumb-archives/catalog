  	    <span class="print-link"></span> <p>The California State University requires that each entering undergraduate, except those who qualify for an exemption, take the CSU Entry Level Mathematics (ELM) examination and the CSU English Placement Test (EPT) prior to enrollment. These placement tests are not a condition for admission to the CSU, but they are a condition of enrollment. These examinations are designed to identify entering students who may need additional support in acquiring college entry-level English and mathematics skills necessary to succeed in CSU baccalaureate-level courses.</p>
<p>If you do not demonstrate college-level skills both in English and in mathematics, you will be placed in appropriate remedial programs and activities during the first term of your enrollment. If placed in remedial programs in either English or mathematics, you must complete all remediation in your <strong>first year</strong> of enrollment. Failure to complete remediation by the end of your first year may result in denial of enrollment for future terms.</p>
<p>Students register for the EPT (<a href="http://www.csuenglishsuccess.org/ept" rel="nofollow">www.csuenglishsuccess.org/ept</a>) and/or ELM <a href="http://www.csumathsuccess.org/elm_exam" rel="nofollow">(http://www.csumathsuccess.org/elm_exam</a>).&#xA0; Campus may establish deadlines by which new students must register for and/or take placement exams as a requirement for enrollment.&#xA0; Questions about test dates and registration materials can be found at <a href="http://www.ets.org/csu" rel="nofollow">www.ets.org/csu</a> or may be addressed to:</p>
