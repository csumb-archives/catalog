<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><strong>Safety concerns</strong>:&#xA0; Flash photography poses a serious hazard to performers on stage.&#xA0; If a photographer is &quot;roving&quot; throughout the audience chamber/seating area and/or on and off stage, there is the potential risk of injury (especially when the theater is dark).</font></li>

  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><strong>Contractual obligations</strong>:&#xA0; Some performers and/or contractual obligations will not allow recording, broadcast and/or documentation of any kind without written permission and agreement in advance of the event.</font></li>

  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><strong>Audience disruption</strong>:&#xA0; Flash photography during a performance is a disruption for some audience members.&#xA0; Also, placement of videographers and video equipment, &quot;roving&quot; photographers and videographers in a limited space like the World Theater could be disruptive to audience members as well.</font></li>
</ul>
