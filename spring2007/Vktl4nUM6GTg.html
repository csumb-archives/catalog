<h5><a name="Leave%20Request%20Procedures"></a>Leave Request Procedures</h5>
<p>Submit a Leave of Absence Request to your appropriate administrator for any paid or unpaid leaves and all medical absences beyond 5 work days. Any change in the length of the leave must be approved. This form is available in the UHR forms page.</p>
<p>Employees are encouraged to meet with Terry Burns, Workers&apos; Compensation &amp; Benefits Analyst (ext. 3387) in UHR for leave advising prior to submitting their request. Additional forms associated with any of our leave programs will be provided upon consultation with UHR-Benefits. Medical certification is required. A formal medical release is required <b>prior</b> to returning from a medical leave.</p>
<p>Faculty requesting non-medical leaves should contact Academic Personnel at ext. 4124 for assistance.</p><a href="#">[TOP]</a> 
<h5 class="topic6"><a name="Non-industrial%20Disability%20Insurance"></a>Non-industrial Disability Insurance</h5>
<p>Employees who are appointed half-time or more for one year of service or one academic year, and who are members of PERS or STRS, are eligible for benefits when disabled due to illness or injury that is not work-related.</p>
<p>This benefit is provided to reduce the financial impact for an employee who suffers a &quot;wage loss&quot; as a result of a non-industrial disability. Payroll Services facilitates Non-industrial Disability insurance forms processing and payments in coordination with the Employment Development Department.</p>
<h5 class="topic6"><a name="Industrial%20Disability%20Leave"></a>Industrial Disability Leave</h5>
<p>All university employees are insured under workers&apos; compensation law for a work-related injury or illness. The CSU arranges and pays for all reasonable charges incurred for medical services in connection with such injury/illness. State employees who are active members of CalPERS or the State Teachers Retirement System are eligible to receive Industrial Disability leave in lieu of Temporary Disability. Claims management is contracted out to a third-party administrator. Employees must report a work-related injury or illness to their immediate supervisor or UHR within 24 hours of the injury. UHR will assist you in accessing and understanding your workers&apos; compensation benefits should you experience a work-related injury or illness.</p><a href="#">[TOP]</a> 
<h5 class="topic6"><a name="Family%20and%20Medical%20Leave"></a>Family and Medical Leave</h5>
<p>Employees with one year of employment at CSUMB are entitled to take a Family and Medical Leave. FML leave is provided in accordance with state and federal laws which grant up to 12 weeks of paid or unpaid leave during a 12-month period to care for yourself, a child, spouse, or parent with a serious health condition. Medical certification is required. While on unpaid leave, the employee may request CSUMB to continue providing benefits coverage. The FML Act provides an employee with the right to reinstatement to the same or another position with equivalent benefits, pay and conditions of employment upon the employee&apos;s return to work at the end of the FML. Other than for pregnancy disability, FML is concurrent with other types of leaves listed here. Refer to the <a href="Images/uhr/CSU%20FML%20POLICY.DOC" target="_blank" class="broken-link">CSU FML Policy</a> for additional information.</p>
<h5 class="topic6"><a name="Catastrophic%20Leave%20Donation%20Program"></a>Catastrophic Leave Donation Program</h5>
<p>Catastrophic Leave is a benefit available to all faculty and staff who accrue sick, and vacation leave. Eligible, disabled employees may receive sick leave or vacation credits donated by other employees on the same campus. The purpose of donated leave is to ease the financial burden of employees who have exhausted all their own leave time for personal or family illnesses.</p>
<p>Employees may initially request donated time for up to three months; an additional three-month period may be approved in exceptional cases. Depending on the amount of time received, an employee will continue to receive a pay warrant (not to exceed their normal full pay), which will keep all health, dental, and vision benefits in active status. While receiving donated time, employees will continue to receive vacation, sick leave, seniority, and service credits.</p><a href="#">[TOP]</a> 
<h5 class="topic6"><a name="Paid%20Maternity/Paternity/Adoption%20Leave"></a>Paid Maternity/Paternity/Adoption Leave</h5>
<p>The university provides paid maternity/paternity/adoption leave benefits to certain employee groups, subject to certain restrictions. Employees requesting this type of leave must meet with UHR to discuss other applicable programs, such as pregnancy disability leave, and how the various leaves are coordinated. Paid maternity/paternity/adoption leave runs concurrently with Family and Medical Leave.</p>
<h5 class="topic6"><a name="Pregnancy-Related%20Disability%20Leave%20(PDL)"></a>Pregnancy-Related Disability Leave (PDL)</h5>
<p>The Government Code entitles female employees up to 6 weeks of time off for normal pregnancy/ delivery and up to 4 months for extended disability related to pregnancy and/or childbirth. This provision guarantees the employee time off from work and a right to return to her same/comparable position.</p><a href="#">[TOP]</a> 
<h5 class="topic6"><a name="Leave%20Without%20Pay%20(LWOP)"></a>Leave Without Pay (LWOP)</h5>
<p>A full-time employee or a regular part-time employee may be granted a full or partial leave of absence without pay for up to one (1) year subject to management approval. Leave Without Pay for 15 days or more is formally requested in writing by the employee. It is important that the employee contact UHR before going on extended Leave Without Pay (over one month) in order to avoid cancellation of group coverage policies, etc. You may take any available vacation as part of the approved period of leave.</p>
<h4 class="topic6"><a name="earned"></a>Earned or Usage-Only Leave Benefits</h4>
<h5><a name="Administrative%20Leave"></a>Administrative Leave</h5>
<p>A paid emergency leave may be granted by the university president in the event of a natural catastrophe or an emergency situation that places the health or safety of the employee(s) in jeopardy. This applies to all employees and is referred to as emergency leave. To be entitled to use emergency leave, the employee must be in active employment status. Typically, an emergency leave will be of short duration.</p><a href="#">[TOP]</a> 
<h5><a name="Compensating%20Time%20Off%20(CTO)"></a>Compensating Time Off (CTO)</h5>

Refer to union contracts and policies for duration of leave and definition of &quot;significantly close relative.&quot; To be entitled to use funeral leave, an employee must be eligible and in active employment status.</p>
<h5><a name="Military%20Leave"></a>Military Leave</h5>
<p>Under the Military and Veterans Code, eligible CSU employees normally receive up to thirty (30) calendar days of CSU pay in a fiscal year for active duty military service.&#xA0; Under certain circumstances employees on Military Leave may receive additional benefits and pay per CSU policy and Federal Rights under The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act.&#xA0;&#xA0; If you enlist, or are otherwise called to active duty by any branch of the Armed Forces, a Military Leave of Absence will be granted in accordance with applicable federal and state laws.</p><a href="#">[TOP]</a> 
<h5><a name="Holiday%20Compensation"></a>Holiday Compensation</h5>
<p>With the exception of retired annuitants and employees in &quot;academic-year&quot; pay classifications, employees in certain employee categories who work on holidays receive CTO or cash. Management Personnel Plan employees and excluded employees who work on holidays receive holiday credit or cash. The amount of compensation depends on the employee category and whether the holiday credit can only be earned in full hour increments.</p>
<h5><a name="Jury%20Duty/Witness"></a>Jury Duty/Witness</h5>
<p>All employees on active employment status are eligible for jury duty. Time off with pay for jury duty will be only for those hours the employee was scheduled to work. Your full salary will continue provided you reimburse the university the amount you are paid for serving as a juror.</p>
<h5><a name="Personal%20Holiday"></a>Personal Holiday</h5>
<p>A personal holiday is a paid day off credited to employees for use during the calendar year. All employees are entitled to one personal holiday per calendar year, January 1 through December 31. If a personal holiday is not taken by December 31, it is forfeited. To be entitled to use a personal holiday an employee must be eligible and in active employment status. Part-time employees earn personal holiday on a pro-rata basis.</p><a href="#">[TOP]</a> 
<h5><a name="Sick%20Leave"></a>Sick Leave</h5>
<p>Sick leave is an accrued benefit, which may be used to care for yourself, an ill or injured &quot;immediate&quot; family member, or for the death of a family member. To be entitled to use sick leave, an employee must be in active employment status. Sick leave is earned at the rate of eight hours (one day) for each full-time qualifying pay period of service. Part-time employees earn sick leave on a pro-rata basis. A qualifying pay period consists of 11 days or more of pay in a pay period for full-time and part-time employees. Sick leave may be used in 15-minute increments for nonexempt employees. There is no limit to the amount of sick leave you can accumulate. Exempt employees may use sick leave in 8 hours or full day if on a flex schedule. The amount of sick leave used may be limited by your employee category.</p>
<h5><a name="Vacation"></a>Vacation</h5>
<p>Vacation is an accrued benefit which provides time off with pay with management approval. Vacation is accrued following completion of a qualifying &quot;month of service.&quot; A qualifying month of service consists of 11 days or more of pay in a pay period for full-time and part-time employees. Accruals earned after 11 days of pay cannot be used until the first day of the following pay period. For intermittent employees, a qualifying month of service consists of 160 hours.</p>
<p>Some employee groups accrue vacation at a rate based on total years of state service. Others accrue vacation at a flat rate regardless of state service.</p>
<p>The amount of accrual is based on the employee&apos;s time base, i.e. full-time = full rate; part-time = pro-rata; intermittent = full-time rate after a month of qualifying service.</p><a href="#">[TOP]</a>

<p>Upon separation from state service, some employees are entitled to a lump-sum vacation payment. Employees who move to an academic-year position or to a position in which vacation credits are neither accrued nor used are entitled to receive a lump-sum payment for the balance at the time of the appointment to the other position. Employees leaving CSU to go to another state agency in which vacation credits are accrued and used differently are entitled to receive a lump-sum payment for the balance at the time of separation.</p>
<p>Employees who separate and move to another campus or non-CSU position within state service may be allowed to carry over a mutually agreed upon vacation balance. (Note: &quot;mutually agreed&quot; implies agreement between the employee and new employer.) The information provided here does not represent complete details about these leave benefits and their effect, if any, on your service credit, status, benefits, and pay. Benefit programs are subject to change.</p><a href="#">[TOP]</a> 
<h5 class="topic6"><a name="Holidays"></a>Holidays</h5>
<p>Employees receive thirteen paid holidays per year. A calendar is distributed to all employees, which contains the schedule of holiday observances and payroll information.</p>
