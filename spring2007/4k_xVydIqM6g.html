<h5><a name="Basic%20Group%20Term%20Life%20Insurance%20Accidental%20Death%20and%20Dismemberment%20Insurance"></a>Basic Group Term Life Insurance and Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance</h5>
<p>Coverage is automatic and provided at no cost to eligible employees.</p>
<p><b class="bold">Note:</b> The IRS permits an employer to provide tax-free life insurance of up to $50,000. You will incur an income tax liability for employer-paid insurance in excess of $50,000, based on your age, at the end of the taxable year. Those employees, who do not want the additional tax liability, may waive the excess coverage at any time, on a prospective basis, by completing a waiver. Such a waiver is irrevocable for the remainder of your employment with the CSU.</p>
<h5><a name="Medex%20Travel%20Assistance%20Benefit"></a>Medex Travel Assistance Benefit</h5>Effective July 1, 2005, the CSU added <a href="http://www.standard.com/eforms/12092.pdf" target="_blank">Medex Travel Assistance</a> to the employer-paid Basic Term Life Insurance coverage through Standard Insurance Company, an automatic benefit for Units 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11<em>(TA&apos;s only),</em> C99, M80, and M98.&#xA0; The coverage is available to all covered members and their eligible dependents.&#xA0; No enrollment is necessary.&#xA0; Simply request a hard copy of the brochure from UHR Benefits and take the enclosed enrollment card with you on your travels.&#xA0;

<p>A long-term disability plan guarantees a level of income if an eligible employee is unable to work due to disability. Coverage is automatic and provided at no cost to eligible employees. LTD benefits become payable after the employee has been continuously disabled for the entire Benefit Waiting Period. LTD benefits are coordinated with other benefits plan payments up to age 65.</p>
<h5><a name="Unemployment%20Insurance"></a>Unemployment Insurance</h5>
<p>Unemployment insurance provides a weekly income to employees who are out of work through no fault of their own. If you become unemployed, contact the nearest Employment Development Department for eligibility and claim filing information.</p><a href="#">[TOP]</a> 
<h5 class="topic6"><a name="Optional%20Voluntary%20Insurance%20Plans"></a>Optional Voluntary Insurance Plans</h5>

<h5 class="topic6"><a name="Tax%20Sheltered%20Annuity%20403(b)"></a>Tax Sheltered Annuity 403(b)</h5>
<p>Eligible employees may defer taxes on a portion of their earnings by investing their deferred salary in a qualified tax sheltered annuity. The deferred income is not subject to current state and federal income taxes; funds are taxed in the year in which they are received. .&#xA0;</p>
<p>In order to establish a salary deferral for a 403(b) account, please pick up a New Account Packet and the authorized list of TSA companies.&#xA0; Contact the Campus Service Center or visit the <a href="http://uhr.csumb.edu/site/x9254.xml#Benefit%20Forms" target="_blank">UHR forms page</a>&#xA0;for informational materials.&#xA0; For specific&#xA0;403(b) guidelines click <a href="http://www.calstate.edu/Benefits/retirement/tsa.page.shtml" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<h5 class="topic6"><a name="State%20Deferred%20Compensation%20(457)%20and%20State%20Thrift%20Plan%20401(k)"></a>State Deferred Compensation (457) and State Thrift Plan 401(k)</h5>
<p>Eligible employees may defer taxes on a portion of their earnings by investing in the Savings Plus Program. Employees have the option of choosing between the State Deferred Compensation Plan (457) and the State Thrift Plan 401(k). The Savings Plus Program offers different investment options plus the opportunity to use a self-managed account to invest in mutual funds.&#xA0;</p>

<h5><a name="Tax%20Advantage%20Premium%20Plan"></a>Tax Advantage Premium Plan</h5>
<p>Benefit-eligible employees are automatically enrolled in the Tax Advantage Premium Plan. This program allows you to pay required health plan premiums from your salary on a pre-tax basis. Premiums for the coverage you have selected will be deducted each month from your salary before federal and state income and Social Security/Medicare taxes are calculated and deducted. This means you will not pay taxes on those premiums-they are converted to tax-free expenses. If you do not wish to participate, contact Payroll Services.</p>
<h5 class="topic6"><a name="Dependent%20Care%20Reimbursemen%20Account"></a>Dependent Care Reimbursement Account</h5>
<p>A voluntary dependent care reimbursement program provides for the payment of certain dependent care expenses from the employee&apos;s pre-tax income, via a special tax-free account set up for this purpose.</p>
<p>Initial enrollment must be made within 60 days of appointment or the qualifying event. Subsequently, employees must file a new <a href="http://uhr.csumb.edu/site/Images/uhr/HCRA_DCRA_Enrollment_FillFo.pdf" target="_blank">dependent care authorization document</a> every year during the annual open enrollment period to continue participation in the new plan year.</p>
<p>The plan year is January through December. The first tax year deduction is made from the December pay period warrant with the issue date of January 1. Once the plan begins, no changes can be made in the amount withheld unless there has been a qualified status change, as defined by the IRS. If contributions are stopped, employees may continue to submit eligible expenses for up to 6 months after the end of the plan year or until their account is exhausted, whichever comes first. Any excess funds left at the end of the plan year will be forfeited. Participants will receive advance warning of this potential action from the claims administrator.</p><a href="#">[TOP]</a> 
<h5 class="topic6"><a name="Health%20Care%20Reimbursemen%20Account"></a>Health Care Reimbursement Account</h5>
<p>This program allows CSU employees to deduct pre-tax dollars that are placed into an account to cover eligible medical/dental/vision expenses that are not covered by insurance plans. Eligible employees DO NOT need to be benefits eligible to participate in this plan.</p>
<p>Initial enrollment must be made within 60 days of appointment or the qualifying event. Subsequently, employees must file a new <a href="http://uhr.csumb.edu/site/Images/uhr/HCRA_DCRA_Enrollment_FillFo.pdf" target="_blank">health care authorization document</a> every year during the annual open enrollment period to continue participation in the new plan year.</p>
<p>The plan year is January through December. The first tax year deduction is made from the December pay period warrant with the issue date of January 1. Once the plan begins, no changes can be made in the amount withheld unless there has been a qualified status change, as defined by the IRS. If contributions are stopped, employees may continue to submit eligible expenses for up to 6 months after the end of the plan year or until their account is exhausted, whichever comes first. Any excess funds left at the end of the plan year will be forfeited. Participants will receive advance warning of this potential action from the claims administrator.</p><a href="#">[TOP]</a> 
<h5><a id="supplemental" name="Supplemental%20Contributions%20Program"></a>Supplemental Contributions Program</h5>
<p>You can add to your retirement security by &quot;supplementing&quot; your CalPERS benefits through their Supplemental Contributions Program. Since earnings in this Program are tax-deferred, you avoid paying taxes on earnings until you&apos;re retired. Your after-tax contributions are invested in a well-diversified portfolio consisting of U.S. equities, U.S. bonds, and international equities. And with low administrative fees, more of your dollars work for you.</p>
<h6>Who is Eligible?</h6>
<p>If you&apos;re currently employed by the State of California (and therefore a CalPERS member) or an active member of the Judges&apos; Retirement System, Judges&apos; Retirement System II, or Legislators&apos; Retirement System you are eligible for the CalPERS Supplemental Contributions Program.</p>
<p>You may also be able to contribute to a deferred compensation or 401(k) plan along with this Program, as long as you remain within the Internal Revenue Code limits.</p>
<h6>Distributions</h6>
<p>Distributions are only allowed at retirement or permanent separation from employment. There are no allowances for emergency distributions.</p>
<h6>Getting Started</h6>
<p>You can make cash contributions or use payroll deductions. To get enrolled, contact Leila Acejas with the Supplemental Contributions Program at P.O. Box 942713, Sacramento, CA 94229-2713, call her toll free at (877) 564-2022, or email her at&#xA0; <a href="mailto:Leila_Acejas@calpers.ca.gov">Leila_Acejas@calpers.ca.gov</a>.</p><a href="#">[TOP]</a>
