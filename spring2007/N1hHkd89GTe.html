<h3 align="center"><font face="Verdana"><font color="navy" size="2">A celebration of Josephine Baker on the 100th anniversary of her birth.</font></font></h3>
<p align="center"><font size="4"><font color="navy"><font face="Verdana"><strong><u>Featuring:</u><br>Imani Winds, music<br><font color="darkblue">Ren</font></strong><font color="#000000" size="2"><font color="darkblue" size="4"><strong>&#xE9;</strong></font>&#xA0;</font></font><font face="Verdana"><strong> Marie, vocals<br>Rolando Morales-Matos, percussion<br>Christopher Huggins, choreography<br>Bobbi Leann Williams, director</strong></font></font></font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><strong>PROGRAM NOTES</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&#x201C;I believe I have a mission on earth: aiding people to join together in friendship and understand each other before it&#x2019;s too late. Terrible mistakes have been made. I see events on the horizon even graver than the disasters of 1939&#x2013;1940. The good are going to suffer for the evil. When mankind casts off its restraints there are no limits to the atrocities it can commit. I&#x2019;m afraid of what may be done in the name of vengeance. There&#x2019;s nothing worse than revenge that springs from hate.&#x201D;<br><em>--Josephine Baker speaking during her tour of Japan after WWII, organized by the French branch of the International League Against Racism &amp; Anti-Semitism.</em></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Josephine Baker was more than just the woman whose body emulated &#x201C;Le Jazz Hot.&#x201D; She was more than the comedic temptress who wowed audiences in Europe as a chanteuse and dancer from the mid-1920s until her death in 1975. Josephine Baker was an amazingly prescient, progressive thinker whose dedication to racial and religious equality motivated her to break barriers, aid the French resistance during World War II, and fight for civil rights across the globe.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Imani Winds has created this biographical program in honor of her centennial, comprising original music by two of Imani&#x2019;s members (Valerie Coleman and Jeff Scott), some of Josephine&#x2019;s most famous songs (arrangements also by Scott), and the works of other artists including composer Fred Ho, choreographer Christopher Huggins, and singer/writer Ren&#xE9; Marie. The performance is divided into three acts: Journey Across The Ocean (which represents her early years and creative re-invention upon her arrival in Paris), Elements of Success (which explores the success she had and the price she paid for it), and Continuous Rebirth (which looks at her life after World War II and her dedication to the human rights campaign).</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The music itself reflects Josephine&#x2019;s two sides: the public performer and the private woman. Jeff Scott&#x2019;s original scoring for Josephine&#x2019;s films and arrangements of her songs represent her on-stage persona - the embodiment of jazz that made her a famous performer for decades. Valerie Coleman&#x2019;s musical memoir, Portraits of Josephine Baker, represents the behind-the-scenes woman. Scored for wind quintet and percussion, the ensemble is accompanied by a dancer and images from Josephine&#x2019;s life and career. Divided into five movements, the suite begins with two sections representing her youth, &#x201C;St. Louis 1920&#x201D; and &#x201C;The Riot of East St. Louis.&#x201D; </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Born to the poor, unwed Carrie McDonald and vaudeville drummer Eddie Carson in 1906, Freda Josephine McDonald grew up in a place and time that forced her to ponder racial issues from a very young age. In her autobiography, Josephine, she remarks that her first truly conscious memory was at the age of 11, when she witnessed the carnage of the 1917 East St. Louis Race Riots and realized that she had to escape that city and the life it offered a poor African-American woman.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Josephine threw herself into performance, staging plays for the neighborhood children and attending shows at the Booker T. Washington theater. She eventually auditioned for Bob Russell&#x2019;s troupe, which was stopping at the theater for two months, and landed her first part. She left St. Louis with the company in 1920. After a few years of traveling, which was marked by a continual struggle for roles (she was often deemed too white and not graceful), she was ultimately discovered while on tour in Noble Sissle and Eubie Blake&#x2019;s Shuffle Along, in which she purposely mugged, crossed her eyes, and acted goofy&#x2014;becoming the star of the chorus line.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Josephine finally reached New York, where she followed another Sissle and Blake show on Broadway with a modest success at The Plantation Club. It wasn&#x2019;t long before her big break walked right into her dressing room: Caroline Dudley invited her to travel to Paris with the show she was producing, le Revue N&#xE8;gre.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&#x201C;France&#x2026;I had dreamed of going there ever since Albert, one of the waiters at the Plantation, had shown me a photograph of the Eiffel Tower. It looked very different from the Statue of Liberty, but what did that matter? What was the good of having the statue without the liberty, the freedom to go where one chose if one was held back by one&#x2019;s color? No, I preferred the Eiffel Tower, which made no promises.&#x201D;<br><em>&#xA0;&#x2013;Josephine Baker</em></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Josephine was a smash in the show&#x2019;s Danse Sauvage, in which she embodied the 1920s jazz sound with her unabashed, wild, and exotic dancing wearing nothing but a skirt of feathers. Coleman&#x2019;s &#x201C;Paris 1925&#x201D; delves into this era, Josephine&#x2019;s entr&#xE9;e into stardom.&#xA0; &#x201C;I wanted to create a lively piece that showed the enthusiasm that Josephine had for Paris, and the daring life of extravagance that she led,&#x201D; says Coleman. With a clarinet solo dedicated to clarinetist Sidney Bechet (who was also in le Revue N&#xE8;gre) and the rhythms of &#x201C;The Charleston&#x201D; (which Josephine danced), Coleman offers a musical window into the immense joy Josephine felt at the acceptance and success she had in Paris.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">She quickly became the toast of the town, was featured at the Folies-Berg&#xE8;re, appeared at her own club, Ch&#xE9;z Josephine, and was seen around town with one of her menagerie of pets (most famously her leopard Chiquita, who had collars matching Josephine&#x2019;s outfits). Films were written as vehicles for her, including La Sir&#xE8;ne des Tropiques (1927) and Princesse Tam Tam (1935), scenes from which are included in La Belle Sir&#xE8;ne Comme le Com&#xE9;dien by Jeff Scott.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Josephine excelled in her role of chanteuse, performing throughout Europe with her then husband/manager Jean Lion (she was married four times, Lion was her third and gave her French citizenship). Josephine&#x2019;s songs that are part of this program (set by Scott and sung by Ren&#xE9; Marie) are snapshots of her dual on-stage personae, the provocateur and comedienne. &#x201C;Donnez moi le main&#x201D; (Give me your hand), about a fortune-teller, and &#x201C;Je Voudrais&#x201D; (I would like) are seductive pieces in which Josephine would often walk throughout the audience and flirt, while &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t Touch My Tomatoes&#x201D; is pure fun, suggestive yet comedic, and a prime example of the goofy sexiness Josephine perfected.&#xA0; &#x201C;Josephine was the type of person that could be very sexually suggestive&#x2014;not sexual&#x2014;suggestive, but comedic at the same time, &#x201C;says Scott. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Though Josephine enjoyed great career success, her personal life suffered. She miscarried, her marriage to Lion ended, and she was physically and mentally exhausted. But Josephine carried on. The two songs by Ren&#xE9; Marie, Autobiography and The South is Mine (arrangements by Scott), reflect the parallels between Ren&#xE9; and Josephine and the struggles they as African-American women endure. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">With the onset of World War II Josephine decided to put her fame to good use as an undercover operative for the French forces. She smuggled information while traveling for performances, helped refugees, and performed for the troops. Unfortunately for Josephine and the resistance, she was struck ill in Casablanca and spent 19 months fighting off various maladies in her lower abdomen. Although she was not fully recovered, she returned to work with the resistance in North Africa and the Middle East and worked until the end of the war. She was awarded the Croix de Guerre, L&#xE9;gion d&apos;Honneur, and Rosette of the R&#xE9;sistance.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Movements 3 and 4 of Coleman&#x2019;s Portraits represent this time in Josephine&#x2019;s life.&#xA0; World War II is a programmatic piece that represents Josephine&#x2019;s resistance work, the war itself, and the recognition she received. Though &#x201C;Casablanca&#x201D; features the famous banana dance, which Josephine presented much earlier in her career, it contemplates the healing power of Josephine&#x2019;s dedication to her causes.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">After the war she continued her personal fight for equality, traveling the globe as an outspoken leader in the civil rights movement. In the United States she would only appear where blacks and whites could attend performances together. She was honored by the NAACP, served as an ambassador for UNICEF, and frequently spoke on behalf of French branch of the International League Against Racism &amp; Anti-Semitism. She and her husband (bandleader Jo Bouillon) began to adopt the &#x201C;Rainbow Tribe,&#x201D; beginning with two war orphans from Japan. The tribe eventually grew to 12 children from a variety of races and religions, and they all lived together at Les Milandes, the chateau in the South of France Josephine had since 1937.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Les Milandes is represented in the fourth movement of Colemen&#x2019;s suite, a tone poem symbolizing another of Josephine&#x2019;s great passions&#x2014;the home in which her &#x201C;Rainbow Tribe&#x201D; could live together and prove to the world that race and religion did not matter. She had dreamed of the chateau as the perfect realization of her ideals, and she wanted to found a school at Les Milandes that promoted tolerance and equality. But in spite of Josephine&#x2019;s continued success as a performer, she couldn&#x2019;t pay the tax debt on the property. She put up an incredible fight, but lost Les Milandes in 1968.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Until her death, Josephine continued to perform, raise her family, and fight for equality, tolerance, and education. In April 1975 she gave a concert at the Bobino Theatre in Paris, which is represented in &#x201C;Farewell Concert&#x201D; the first part of Paris 1975, the fifth movement of Coleman&#x2019;s suite. On stage she was energetic and masterful, as if she had barely aged since she had premiered in le Revue N&#xE8;gre over 50 years before. She died in her sleep just a few days later.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The final part of Coleman&#x2019;s work, Thank You Josephine, is an arrangement of Josephine&#x2019;s most famous song, &#x201C;J&#x2019;ai Deux Amours&#x201D; (I have two loves), and represents her amazing, generous spirit. She often said that she had two loves, her country and Paris, but she had two lives as well: vivacious performer and dedicated human being. Josephine Baker was truly a remarkable individual, and the world is a much better place having had her in it.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&#x201C;Surely the day will come when color means nothing more than the skin tone, when religion is seen uniquely as a way to speak one&apos;s soul; when birth places have the weight of a throw of the dice and all men are born free, when understanding breeds love and brotherhood.&#x201D;<br>&#x2013; Josephine Baker</font></p><font size="1">
<p align="center"><br><font face="Verdana" size="2"><strong>ARTIST BIOGRAPHIES <br>IMANI WINDS<br>VALERIE COLEMAN, flute&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; TOYIN SPELLMAN-DIAZ, oboe&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; <br>MARIAM ADAM, clarinet&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; JEFF SCOTT, French horn&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; MONICA ELLIS, bassoon</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The five accomplished musicians of Imani Winds joined forces in 1997 to expand the boundaries of the traditional wind quintet and explore the links between European, African and American music traditions. The name Imani, which literally means &#x201C;faith&#x201D; in Swahili, embodies this mission. In their time together, this young ensemble of African/Latin American heritage has established a distinct presence in the classical music world for dynamic playing, innovative programming, and inspirational outreach programs, which often explore the culture and heritage of the African Diaspora while introducing Western classical traditions to diverse classroom audiences.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">One need only look at a concert program offered by Imani Winds to appreciate their commitment to the expansion and diversification of the wind quintet repertoire. From Mendelssohn, Jean Fran&#xE7;aix, Gy&#xF6;rgy Ligeti, and Luciano Berio, to Astor Piazzola, Elliott Carter and John Harbison; to the unexpected ranks of Paquito D&#x2019;Rivera, Tania Le&#xF3;n and Fred Ho, Imani Winds actively seek to bring new music into the wind quintet literature. Imani members Valerie Coleman and Jeff Scott both contribute compositions and arrangements to the ensemble&#x2019;s expanding repertoire. The ensemble has adopted new textures and sounds into the quintet by employing folk influences and percussive elements, and through collaborations which have included Latin American legends such as Paquito D&#x2019;Rivera and bandoneonist Daniel Binelli, as well as Gilbert Kalish and David Shifrin.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Imani Winds tour extensively in 2005-2006, including their San Francisco debut at the Herbst Theater for San Francisco Performances. Additionally, they demonstrate their commitment to exploring new forms by creating and presenting a tribute to the legendary Josephine Baker on the 100th anniversary of her birth, reaching across disciplines to include dance and song. Titled Josephine Baker: A Life of Le Jazz Hot!, it is in collaboration with chanteuse Ren&#xE9; Marie and others, and premiered in Pittsburgh at the August Wilson Center in spring of 2006.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the 2004-2005 season Imani Winds released their first major-label recording, The Classical Underground (KOCH International Classics), which was subsequently nominated for a 2005 Grammy Award. Also that season, their Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center residency culminated in a recital in New York&#x2019;s Alice Tully Hall with renowned clarinetist/saxophonist/composer Paquito D&#x2019;Rivera. The ensemble performed sextets with pianist Gilbert Kalish at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and appeared at La Jolla Music Society, Seattle&#x2019;s Meany Hall, Krannert Center for the Performing Arts, Ensemble Music Society of Indianapolis, made a return appearance at the Virginia Arts Festival, and made their Canadian debut at Ottawa&#x2019;s Christ Church Cathedral. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Past highlights include performances at Atlanta&#x2019;s National Black Arts Festival, Carnegie Hall&#x2019;s Weill Recital Hall, Chicago Symphony Musicians Residency Program, the Ravinia Festival, the Kennedy Center, and the Philadelphia Chamber Music Society. During the 200320-04 season Imani Winds enjoyed national exposure with broadcasts on NPR&#x2019;s Saint Paul Sunday and Performance Today. The ensemble has completed two international tours with eminent saxophonist Steve Coleman and can be heard on his recording The Ascension to Light. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Two-time winner of the CMA/ASCAP Award for &#x201C;Adventurous Programming,&#x201D; Imani Winds was selected to become resident-artists of Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center in their professional residency program CMSLC II beginning in the 2003-2004 season. More recently, the quintet received the 2003 &#x201C;Meet the Composer&#x201D; Commissioning Music/USA Award, and in 2004 debuted New York native Fred Ho&#x2019;s Josephine Baker&#x2019;s Angels from the Rainbow. In 2001, Imani Winds won the Concert Artist Guild competition and subsequently became the CAG&#x2019;s first Educational Residency Ensemble in recognition of their outstanding educational mission and tremendous musical abilities. They are also recipients of the Artists International Annual New York Debut Prize.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In 2002, the group released their CMA/WQXR award winning debut recording entitled Umoja (featuring original works by Imani flutist, Valerie Coleman). Classical Underground, was released on the KOCH label in January 2005 and their second CD for KOCH, titled Imani Winds, was released in January of 2006.

His greatest influence however, came from his first teacher, Carolyn Clark, who taught the young Mr. Scott for free during his high school years, giving him the opportunity to study music when resources were not available. He received his bachelor&apos;s degree from Manhattan School of Music, and master&apos;s degree from SUNY at Stony Brook. During those years Mr. Scott studied with Jerome Ashby, David Jolley, Scott Brubaker and William Purvis. It was during his collegiate studies that Mr. Scott learned wind quintet repertoire through intense coaching with the late Samuel Baron of the New York Wind Quintet.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Mr. Scott&apos;s performance credits are many and varied. They include <em>The Lion King</em> orchestra (on Broadway, New York) 1997-2005, and other Broadway shows such as On the Town and Showboat. He has been a member of the Alvin Ailey and Dance Theater of Harlem orchestras since 1995 and has performed under the direction of Wynton Marsalis and Arturo O&apos;Farrill with the Lincoln Center Jazz and Afro-Latin Jazz orchestras.&#xA0; Mr. Scott has also experienced good fortune as a studio musician.

<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><strong>RACHAEL ASHLEY, dancer</strong><br>Rachael Ashley grew up in Northern California. She holds a BFA in Dance and a BS in Business Management from the University of Arizona. Ms Ashley was a member of the Cleo Parker Robinson Dance Ensemble in Denver, Colorado for five years.&#xA0; In her last year with the company, she served as assistant rehearsal director. Rachael has worked with renowned choreographers such as Donald McKayle, Eleo Pomare, David Rousseve, and Christopher Huggins. For the past nine months, Ms Ashley has worked as a freelance artist, traveling and continuing her training in Europe and the United States.&#xA0; She is very excited to be working with Imani Winds on Josephine Baker: A Life of Le Jazz Hot!, and would like to thank her family and Jared for their continuous love and support of her passion to dance.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><strong>CHRISTOPHER HUGGINS, choreographer</strong><br>Since his departure from the renowned Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre, Christopher Huggins works as a dancer, teacher, and choreographer throughout Europe, Japan and the U.S. Mr. Huggins attended SUNY Purchase and Julliard, where he also maintained a merit scholarship at the Ailey School.

<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><strong>REN&#xC9; MARIE, vocalist</strong><br>Ren&#xE9; Marie - vocalist, composer and musical risk-taker - has taken the jazz world by surprise. The 1998 release of her self-produced debut CD, Renaissance, turns the formerly bouncy Mr. Sandman into a steamy stroll through restless yearning and exposes Tennessee Waltz as a gut-bucket blues-yodel about lust and betrayal, revealing the artistry and abandon with which Ren&#xE9; Marie claims new ownership of time-worn standards. On How Can I Keep From Singing? her first release on the MAXJAZZ label, she hits the ground running with a positive interpretation of God Bless the Child at a blistering tempo, then abruptly shifts gears by pairing the spiritual Motherless Child with a graphic portrayal of Four Women. Vertigo, her second MAXJAZZ project, is full of emotional and vocal twists and turns in a musical landscape that covers everything from the love-passion conundrum, Don&#x2019;t Look At Me Like That, to the controversial pairing of the confederate anthem Dixie with the anti-lynching lament Strange Fruit. The Academie du Jazz (Paris, France) selected Vertigo The Best International Jazz Vocal CD of 2002. Other nominees were Joni Mitchell and Cassandra Wilson. Jazz Times Magazine UK selected Vertigo the Top Jazz Vocal CD of 2002. In just the third week of being released, Ren&#xE9;&#x2019;s new CD, Live At Jazz Standard, reached number 20 on the Billboard Jazz Chart. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jazz critics and reviewers have tried to suggest that Ren&#xE9; is from the same mold as other great jazz vocalists of the past. Though not bad company to be in, these singers are not her true influences. Ren&#xE9;&#x2019;s life journey took her in directions that brought an eclectic group of musical and creative sources to her attention. During her formative years in her hometown of Warrenton, Virginia, she listened to Maurice Ravel, Hank Williams, and Harry Belafonte, and learned harmony from Peter, Paul &amp; Mary and the Beatles. Four years after moving to Roanoke, Virginia, she was taking classical piano lessons while at the same time singing in R&amp;B bands. Sly and the Family Stone, Roberta Flack, Nina Simone and James Brown were some of her tutors in rhythm, emotional intensity and improvisation. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Married at 18 and a mother of two sons by 23, Ren&#xE9; took a hiatus from singing in public to raise her family. But this shift in focus proved to be a period of incubation. Ren&#xE9; started listening to jazz and began, for the first time, to compose. She continued to sing at home - exposing herself and her sons to a wide variety of music genres, including show tunes, jazz, hip-hop, world music and rap. Her jazz influences read more like a recipe &#x2013; Joe Zawinul&#x2019;s energy and insistence on originality, Strayhorn&#x2019;s moods and Monk&#x2019;s quirky note choices. All these elements, plus a wealth of life experiences, contribute to the open and adventurous spirit in her arrangements and compositions, distinguishing her from the rest of the pack. Most of all, Ren&#xE9; learned the importance of exploring the depths of a melodic story, taking chances and giving old standards new meaning and possibilities. Perhaps enigmatic artists like Ren&#xE9; Marie make traditionalists a bit uncomfortable, but Ren&#xE9; has proven that truly listening to one&#x2019;s own voice is the very core of jazz artistry. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ren&#xE9; Marie&#x2019;s live performances can only be described as a transformation. The soft-spoken artist takes to the stage and turns it into a voodoo possession with her band. Her burning rhythms and tonal density make each song an experience beyond the typical jazz presentation. She swoops, yodels, seduces and conjures notes that leave the audience emotionally drained and satisfied. Ren&#xE9; Marie is a formidable artist at a time when the jazz world is desperately trying to decide who will be the &#x201C;new leaders&#x201D; of jazz. </font></p>
