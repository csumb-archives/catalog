<p><br><span class="Title">Financial Aid ~ Student Loan Programs</span></p><p>Loan programs provide aid that must be repaid.</p>

<p>CSUMB participates in two federal loan programs-the Federal Perkins and the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP).</p>

<h5>Federal Perkins Loan</h5>

<p>The Federal Perkins Loan is a low interest, long-term loan made available through the CSUMB Financial Aid Office. The current interest rate is five percent. The average Perkins Loan award is $1,500 per year.</p>

<h5>Federal Family Education Loan Program</h5>

<p>FFELP makes federal government loans available through participating banks and financial institutions. There are four federal loans in the program: the Subsidized Stafford Loan, the Unsubsidized Stafford Loan, the Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS), and the Grad Plus for Graduate students. The Financial Aid Office determines your eligibility for loans.</p>

<p>The Federal Stafford Loan is available to students whose cost of attendance has not been fully met through other aid. The interest rate is set by the federal government every July 1.  Payments on the loan may be deferred during the time you are enrolled in school at least half-time. To retain deferred status, you must enroll each semester in at least six credits of undergraduate or four credits of master&apos;s degree coursework. Loan funds cannot be released if you have dropped below half-time status, have not made satisfactory progress, or have any university holds. </p>

<h5>Types of FFELP Loans:</h5>

<p>The <strong>Subsidized Stafford Loan</strong> is available only to students with financial need. During the time recipients are in school (enrolled half time or more), the federal government will pay the interest. You begin payment of interest and principle six months after you are no longer enrolled at least half time.</p>

<p>The <strong>Unsubsidized Stafford Loan</strong> has the same terms and interest rate as the Subsidized Stafford Loan, but the federal government does not pay the interest while students are in school. Consequently, interest is charged on the loan from the date you receive the loan. Payments may be deferred, but the interest accrued while you are in school is added to the amount borrowed.</p>

<p>The federal government has set the following annual limits for Subsidized and Unsubsidized Stafford Loans:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Freshman (0-29 earned credits) ~ $3,500</li>

  <li>Sophomore (30-59 earned credits) ~ $4,500</li>

  <li>Junior, Senior, and Teaching Credential (60+ earned credits) ~ $5,500</li>

  <li>Graduate Student ~ $8,500</li>
</ul>

<p>The aggregate limits for the Stafford loan program for undergraduates, second bachelor&apos;s, and teaching credential programs is $23,000. The aggregate limits for graduate degree seeking student  (including amounts borrowed for undergraduate study) is $65,000.</p>

<p>In addition to the loan amounts above, if you qualify as independent, you may also borrow an <strong>Additional Unsubsidized Stafford Loan</strong>. Eligibility is limited by the amount of your cost of attendance and is determined by subtracting any financial aid resources received from your costs of education. If an undergraduate student graduating in December, you are also limited to prorated amounts based on the number of credits for which you are enrolled.</p>

<p>The annual loan limits for the Additional Unsubsidized Stafford Loan are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Freshman (0-29 earned credits) ~ $4,000</li>

  <li>Sophomore (30-59 earned credits) ~ $4,000</li>

  <li>Junior, Senior (60+ earned credits) ~ $5,000</li>

  <li>Second Bachelor&apos;s Degree and Teaching Credential ~ $5,000</li>

  <li>Graduate Student ~ $12,000</li>
</ul>

<p>The aggregate limits for the Additional Unsubsidized Stafford are $23,000 for undergraduate, second bachelor&apos;s, and teaching credential programs, and $73,000 for graduate degree seeking student (including amounts borrowed for undergraduate study).</p>

<p>Dependent students are not eligible for additional unsubsidized loans unless their parents apply for and are denied the PLUS loan (see below).</p>

<p><em>Disbursement of Loan Funds</em></p>

<p>If your award includes a loan that you wish to accept, you can go onto the <a href="http://www.edfund.org">edfund.org</a> website to accept your loan.  The federal government also requires that entrance loan counseling be provided before you receive your first Stafford Loan check. If you are a first time borrower, you must complete the entrance loan counseling on the <a href="http://www.edfund.org">edfund.org</a> website. <strong>Loan amounts will not be disbursed until the loan counseling session requirement has been completed.   </strong></p>

<p>Exit loan counseling is also required for all Stafford Loan borrowers. You must contact the Financial Aid Office within 30 days from the date that you graduate, withdraw, or drop below half-time status.</p>

<p>All loans are issued in two installments, even if you are attending for only one semester. For academic-year loans, the second disbursement will be released at the beginning of the spring semester. For one-semester loans, it will arrive in the middle of the term. </p>

<p>All funds are transferred from the lender to CSUMB. Once funds have been received at CSUMB, they must be disbursed within 30 days. If there is a hold on your student record that prevents CSUMB from releasing the loan, CSUMB will send you a letter. You must respond before the date designated in that letter, or the <strong>funds</strong> <strong>will be returned to the lender.</strong></p>

<p>If applicable, Stafford loan funds may be used to pay any outstanding charges owed to the university including registration fees, tuition, housing, and miscellaneous charges.</p>

<p><em>Assumption Program of Loans for Education</em></p>

<p>The APLE program helps students who become teachers to repay their federal Stafford Loans if they teach in California&apos;s public schools in designated areas. You should apply as soon as you have achieved junior status but no later than the year before completing your credential program. Applications are available in late March of each year.</p>

<h6>Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students</h6>

<p>The PLUS is available to parents of dependent students. The interest rate is fixed at 8.5 percent.</p>

<p>Repayment begins 60 days of the date the loan is fully disbursed. The minimum monthly payment is $50 and the repayment period is 10 years, except that borrowers with balances over $30,000 can receive a repayment period of up to 25 years.  </p>

<p>PLUS amounts are determined by subtracting all financial aid awarded from the student budget.  All parent borrowers must undergo a credit check and can be denied the loan if an adverse credit history is found. However, most resolved credit issues are disregarded.  If approved, all PLUS funds are sent to CSUMB in two installments and are made payable to the student. Loan funds cannot be released if the student has dropped below half-time status, has not made satisfactory academic progress, or has any university holds. PLUS funds may be used to pay any outstanding charges owed to the university including registration fees, tuition, housing, and miscellaneous charges.</p>
