<p>Welcome to CSU Monterey Bay!  As the Vice President for Student Affairs, I want to invite you to become an active member of this very special community.  Becoming involved in your classes and the many aspects of campus life will provide a great connection and make you feel at home as you work closely with the many new people you will meet.  Faculty and staff members, plus your new student colleagues, are here to support you and your success as a student!</p>

<p>The staff members in the Division of Student Affairs are here to provide the administrative and educational services focused on your learning and your success.  Life inside and outside of the classroom will be richer and more exciting if you explore what you are learning within the context of this University and invest your time and talents in this diverse community.
