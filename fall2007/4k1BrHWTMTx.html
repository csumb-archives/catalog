<p><br><span class="Title">Multiple Subject Credential ~ Requirements</span></p><h5>Semester Credits Required</h5>

<p>Total credits: 36</p>

<p>Credits at CSUMB: 36</p>

<p>Credits in the program: 36</p>

<h5>Outcomes, Courses, and Assessment</h5>

<p>The philosophy and purposes of&#xA0;all educator preparation programs at CSUMB are evidenced in outcome skills, knowledge, and dispositions in our teacher candidates as they complete their programs.&#xA0;Our candidates demonstrate effective teaching practices in multicultural, pluralistic settings as they seek to contribute to a socially just society.&#xA0;Our curricula are all outcomes-based, and result in the achievement of program standards.&#xA0;</p>

<h6>Skill and Knowledge Outcomes</h6>

<p>All&#xA0;credential programs are based on the California Standards for the Teaching Professions (CSTPs).&#xA0;Our expectations are outcome behaviors, knowledge, and skills directly related to the effective teaching practices embodied in the standards.&#xA0;The CSTPs are restated here as a major portion of the outcomes of all credential programs.&#xA0;</p>

<p><strong>CSTP 1&#xA0; Making subject matter comprehensible to students</strong></p>

<p><strong>CSTP 2&#xA0; Assessing student learning</strong></p>

<p><strong>CSTP 3&#xA0; Engaging and supporting students in learning</strong></p>

<p><strong>CSTP 4&#xA0; Planning instruction and designing learning experiences for students</strong></p>

<p><strong>CSTP 5&#xA0; Creating and maintaining effective environments for student learning</strong></p>

<p><strong>CSTP 6&#xA0; Developing as a professional educator</strong></p>

<p>The following additional program learning outcome has been described for our CSUMB credential programs:</p>

<p><strong>LO&#xA0;7&#xA0; Planning and implementing an inclusive, multicultural, and assets-based curriculum</strong></p>

<p>You demonstrate these outcomes in course settings and during practical training experiences through measures that are integrated with the curriculum.&#xA0; As our program prepares you to demonstrate successful beginning practice in teaching, you satisfy the CSTPs by successfully completing all of the courses listed, and through your preparation of a professional portfolio. You prepare products in each of your courses and compile them into&#xA0;your professional portfolio,&#xA0;&#xA0;which you present at the&#xA0;conclusion of the program. You include reflective comments, a personal philosophy statement about teaching, and supporting documentation such as observation reports of your teaching in your portfolio as well.</p>

<h6>Dispositional Outcomes</h6>

<p>The Teacher Education Department has adopted a set of professional dispositions that are to be demonstrated by candidates as part of the requirements for program completion.&#xA0; These dispositions include the following.</p>

<p><strong>Professional educators are committed to ethical conduct:&#xA0; fairness, honesty, responsibility, compassion, collaboration, collegiality.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Professional educators believe all students can and will experience academic success.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Professional educators believe individual differences in learners are assets to be accommodated in the classroom.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Professional educators are inclined towards being advocates who identify and strive to eliminate inequities, social injustice, and prejudice as stewards of public education for a just society.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Professional educators reflect on their own practices in a process that leads to continual improvement.</strong></p>

<p>The means for conveying professional dispositions and evaluating their achievement include&#xA0;course assignments; instructional plans; applied assessments; field experiences and other practical training; observed teaching practices and other interactions with students in a classroom; and reflection assignments and self-reflection.</p>&#xA0;<br></td>
