<p><br><span class="Title">College of Professional Studies ~ Dean &amp; Staff</span></p><h5>Martin Tadlock, Ph.D., Dean</h5>
<p>Welcome to the College of Professional Studies!&#xA0; I hope you find the program information you are seeking on our website.&#xA0; If you don&#x2019;t, or have questions about anything you see, don&#x2019;t hesitate to get in touch with the appropriate department chair, support staff, or myself.&#xA0; </p>
<p>This is my fourth university.&#xA0; Before coming to CSUMB, I was a middle school teacher for nine years in St. George, Utah.&#xA0; I then taught elementary and middle school education courses while serving as Director of the Center of Education for the Young Adolescent at the University of Wisconsin-Platteville for three years.&#xA0; I later spent eight years teaching middle and secondary education courses at Utah State University, where I served one year as Associate Dean for the College of Education.&#xA0; Finally, I spent five years at Bemidji State University in Minnesota, where I was Dean of the College of Professional Studies, teaching graduate courses in middle school education.&#xA0; I came here in July 2006.</p>
<p>I am excited about CSUMB!&#xA0; The campus is being physically created within a 25-year renovation plan for the old Ft. Ord military complex.&#xA0; It is also being intellectually created through the hard work of highly dedicated faculty and staff who collaborate with students to create our campus culture of learning.&#xA0; In 12 short years, CSUMB has managed to create a national reputation in several areas (which some universities never attain), and is moving forward in designing and redesigning itself to meet the educational needs of all people, not just a select group as some institutions tend to do.&#xA0; </p>
<p>Also, faculty and staff in this college are not content to be good at what we do; we will be great at what we do, and do it with a passion!&#xA0; You should know that as Dean, some of my priorities are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Academic excellence in all College of Professional Studies programs 
</li><li>A challenging, yet civil and respectful, learning environment 
</li><li>Creation of new and innovative programs with flexibility for students to access and complete courses in those programs 
</li><li>Collaborative, collegial working relationships between and among faculty, students, and staff where voices are heard and valued 
</li><li>Clearly identifiable pathways with accurate, detailed advising so that students can access appropriate programs and courses</li></ul>
<p>Again, if you have questions for us, get in touch.&#xA0; We are here to serve you.</p>
<p>Welcome to CSUMB!</p>
<h5>Crescenda Zuccaro, Administrative Analyst Specialist</h5>

Please do not hesitate to contact the Dean&#x2019;s Office if you have any questions.</p>
