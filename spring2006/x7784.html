<p>During this required introductory seminar the cultural and political context of learning are critically examined&#x2014;especially with regard to providing effective educational experiences for diverse populations. Utilizing the lens of various research traditions, participants work to contrast differing perspectives and ways of knowing. In addition to building library research skills, students actively contribute to change or the existing knowledge base by engaging in action research. (Offered fall and spring semesters.)</p>

<p>The focus of this course is predicated on the assumption that given the linguistically and culturally diverse student population of the region and state, effective teachers must align what and how they teach with the lived experiences of their students. Thus, to deepen understanding of Latino cultures and societies, participants explore significant historical periods and events in Latino cultures, with an emphasis on Mexico. Contributes toward the BCLAD certificate. (Offered occasionally.)</p>

<p>In a supportive and collaborative setting, participants engage in in-depth and critical analysis of professional literature as they further define and frame their interests or contextualize their action thesis projects. Students use online resources to identify important theoretical and empirical contributions that connect their research to existing professional literature. Emphasis is placed on learning the conventions of academic writing using the APA guide, as well as bringing out one&#x2019;s voice in the writing process. (Offered spring semester.)</p>
