<h6><font color="dimgray">41302. Disposition of Fees: Campus Emergency; Interim Suspension</font></h6>

<p><font color="dimgray">The president of the campus may place on probation, suspend, or expel a student for one or more of the causes enumerated in Section 41301. No fees or tuition paid by or for such student for the semester, quarter, or summer session in which he or she is suspended or expelled shall be refunded. If the student is readmitted before the close of the semester, quarter, or summer session in which he or she is suspended, no additional tuition or fees shall be required of the student on account of the suspension.</font></p>

<p><font color="dimgray">During periods of campus emergency, as determined by the president of the individual campus, the president may, after consultation with the chancellor, place into immediate effect any emergency regulations, procedures, and other measures deemed necessary or appropriate to meet the emergency, safeguard persons and property, and maintain educational activities.</font></p>

<p><font color="dimgray">The president may immediately impose an interim suspension in all cases in which there is reasonable cause to believe that such an immediate suspension is required in order to protect lives or property and to insure the maintenance of order. A student so placed on interim suspension shall be given prompt notice of charges and the opportunity for a hearing within 10 days of the imposition of interim suspension. During the period of interim suspension, the student shall not, without prior written permission of the president or designated representative, enter any campus of the California State University other than to attend the hearing. Violation of any condition of interim suspension shall be grounds for expulsion.</font></p>

<h6><font color="dimgray">41303. Conduct by Applicants for Admission</font></h6>

<p><font color="dimgray">Notwithstanding any provision in this Chapter 1 to the contrary, admission or readmission may be qualified or denied to any person who, while not enrolled as a student, commits acts which, were that person enrolled as a student, would be the basis for disciplinary proceedings pursuant to Sections 41301 or 41302. Admission or readmission may be qualified or denied to any person who, while a student, commits acts which are subject to disciplinary action pursuant to Section 41301 or Section 41302. Qualified admission or denial of admission in such cases shall be determined under procedures adopted pursuant to Section 41304.</font></p>

<h6><font color="dimgray">41304. Student Disciplinary Procedures for the California State University</font></h6>

<p><font color="dimgray">The chancellor shall prescribe, and may from time to time revise, a code of student disciplinary procedures for the California State University. Subject to other applicable law, this code shall provide for determinations of fact and sanctions to be applied for conduct which is a ground of discipline under Sections 41301 or 41302, and for qualified admission or denial of admission under Section 41303; the authority of the campus president in such matters; conduct-related determinations on financial aid eligibility and termination; alternative kinds of proceedings, including proceedings conducted by a hearing officer; time limitations; notice; conduct of hearings, including provisions governing evidence, a record, and review; and such other related matters as may be appropriate. The chancellor shall report to the Board actions taken under this section.</font></p>

<h5>Enforcement Process</h5>

<p>The Judicial Affairs Officer represents the university community&#x2019;s interests during the enforcement process. The Judicial Affairs Officer is empowered to investigate the allegations against the student, to decide whether or not sufficient evidence exists to file a complaint, and to represent CSUMB at the hearing.</p>

<p>The Judicial Affairs Officer and other members of the university community may also work with students to resolve the issues in question before a hearing becomes necessary. Detailed information about student conduct policies and procedures is available from the CSUMB Judicial Affairs.</p>
