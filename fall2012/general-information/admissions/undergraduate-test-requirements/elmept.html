    <span class="print-link"></span> <p>The California State University requires that each entering undergraduate, except those who qualify for an exemption, take the CSU Entry Level Mathematics (ELM) examination and the CSU English Placement Test (EPT) prior to enrollment. These placement tests are not a condition for admission to the CSU, but they are a condition of enrollment. These examinations are designed to identify entering students who may need additional support in acquiring college entry-level English and mathematics skills necessary to succeed in CSU baccalaureate-level courses.</p>
<p>If you do not demonstrate college-level skills both in English and in mathematics, you will be placed in appropriate remedial programs and activities during the first term of your enrollment. If placed in remedial programs in either English or mathematics, you must complete all remediation in your <strong>first year</strong> of enrollment. Failure to complete remediation by the end of your first year may result in denial of enrollment for future terms.</p>
<p>You may register for the EPT and ELM at your local CSU campus. Questions about test dates and registration materials can be found at <a href="http://www.ets.org/csu" rel="nofollow">www.ets.org/csu</a> or may be addressed to:</p>

<h5>Entry Level Mathematics Placement Examination</h5>
<ul></ul>
<p>The ELM examination for entry-level mathematics skills acquired through three years of rigorous college preparatory mathematics coursework (Algebra I, Algebra II, and Geometry). All undergraduate students must take the test or be exempted from it prior to placement in appropriate university mathematics coursework. The campus will determine specific policies regarding retesting and placement.</p>
<p> Exemptions from the test are given only to those students who can present proof of one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A score of &quot;Exempt&quot; on the augmented mathematics California Standards Test, i.e. the CSU Early Assessment Program (EAP), taken in grade 11.</li>

</ul>
<h5>Early Start Program</h5>
<p>Beginning with the class of 2012, entering resident freshmen who are not proficient in math or &#x201C;at risk&#x201D;&#xA0;in English will need to start the remediation process before their first term. By 2014, all new freshmen&#xA0;students who have not demonstrated college-readiness in mathematics and English will need to begin&#xA0;work on becoming ready for college-level English before the start of their first term.</p>
<p>The goals of Early Start Program are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add an important and timely assessment tool in preparing students for college; and</li>
<li>Better prepare students in math and English, before the fall semester of freshman year;</li>
<li>Improve students&#x2019; chances of successful completion of a college degree.</li>
</ul>
<p>For 2012, resident students would be required to participate in the Early Start Program if their ELM&#xA0;score is less than 50 and/or their EPT score is less than 138. Newly admitted freshman students who are&#xA0;required to complete Early Start will be notified of the requirement and options for completing the&#xA0;program as part of campus communications to newly admitted students.</p>
