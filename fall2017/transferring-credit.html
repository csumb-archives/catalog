<p>
Once you have been admitted to the University, CSUMB Office of Admissions will analyze and record your advanced placement course credit, transfer credit, and other credit for which you may be eligible and will establish a permanent student record for you. This permanent record will eventually include your official transcript of all courses taken at CSUMB and their associated grades. Your student record may also include a recording of additional credit for which you may be eligible by virtue of specific tests and assessments, and a summary record of all transfer credit from previous colleges or universities you may have attended. Transfer credits may be recorded on your Degree Audit where appropriate. For information on how these credits may apply to your degree requirements, contact your specific program.

</p>

<p>
In accordance with Title 5 of the California Code of Regulations, Section 40409 a maximum of 70 semester credits earned at a community college may be applied toward your undergraduate degree, with the following limitations:

      </li>
      <li>
        No credit may be allowed for professional courses in education taken at a community college, other than an introduction to education course.
      </li>
</ul>
