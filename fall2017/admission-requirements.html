<p>
Generally, applicants will qualify for consideration for first&#45;time freshman admission if they meet the following requirements:

</p>

<ul>
      <li>
        Have <em>graduated</em> from high school, have earned a Certificate of General Education Development &#40;GED&#41;, or have passed the California High School Proficiency Examination &#40;CHSPE&#41;;
      </li>
      <li>
        Have a qualifiable eligibility index &#40;see section on Eligibility Index below&#41;; and
      </li>
      <li>
        Have completed with grades of C or better each of the courses in the comprehensive pattern of college preparatory subject requirements also known as the "a&#45;g" pattern &#40;see <a href="https://www2.calstate.edu/apply/freshman/getting_into_the_csu/pages/admission-requirements.aspx">Subject Requirements</a>&#41;
      </li>
</ul>

<p>
Contact a high school or community college counselor, or <a href="&#109;a&#x69;&#108;&#x74;&#111;&#x3a;&#97;&#x64;&#109;&#x69;&#115;s&#x69;&#111;&#x6e;&#115;&#x40;&#99;&#x73;&#117;&#x6d;&#98;&#x2e;&#101;d&#x75;">CSUMB Office of Admissions</a> if you have questions.

<p>
The eligibility index is the combination of the high school grade point average and scores on either the ACT or the SAT. Grade point averages &#40;GPA&#41; are based on grades earned in courses taken during the final three years of high school. Included in calculation of GPA are grades earned in all college preparatory “a&#45;g” subject requirements, and bonus points for approved honors courses. Up to eight semesters of honors courses taken in the last three years of high school, including up to two approved courses taken in the tenth grade can be accepted. Each unit of A in an honors course will receive a total of 5points; B, 4 points; and C, 3 points.

</p>

<p>
A CSU Eligibility Index &#40;EI&#41; can be calculated by multiplying your grade point average by 800 and adding your total score on the SAT exam <em>&#40;mathematics and critical reading scores on the old SAT, or mathematics and Evidence&#45;Based Reading and Writing on the new SAT&#41;</em>. For students who took the ACT, multiply the grade point average by 200 and add ten times the ACT composite score. Persons who are California high school graduates &#40;or residents of California for tuition purposes&#41; need a minimum index of 2900 using the SAT or 694 using the ACT. The Eligibility Index Table illustrates several combinations of required test scores and averages. The University has no current plans to include the writing scores from either of the admissions tests in the computation of the CSU Eligibility Index.  Note:  The minimum Eligibility Index requirement for admission to the Fall 2018 term will increase to 2950 using the SAT.

</p>

<p>
Persons who neither graduated from a California high school nor are a resident of California for tuition purposes, need a minimum index of 3502 &#40;SAT&#41; or 842 &#40;ACT&#41;. Note:  The minimum Eligibility Index requirement for admission to the Fall 2018 term will increase to 3570 using the SAT.  Graduates of secondary schools in foreign countries must be judged to have academic preparation and abilities equivalent to applicants eligible under this section. An applicant with a grade point average of 3.00 or above &#40;3.61 for nonresidents&#41; is not required to submit test scores. However,all applicants for admission are urged to take the SAT or ACT and provide the scores of such tests to each CSU to which they seek admission. Campuses use these test results for advising and placement purposes and may require them for admission to impacted majors or programs. Impacted CSU campuses require SAT or ACT scores of all applicants for freshman admission.

Applicants with disabilities are encouraged to complete college preparatory course requirements. In certain circumstances, if you are judged unable to fulfill a specific course requirement because of a disability, alternate college preparatory courses may be substituted for specific subject requirements. Substitutions may be authorized on a case&#45;by&#45;case basis after review of disability documentation and academic records and recommendation by your academic advisor or guidance counselor in consultation with the director of a CSU disabled student services program. You should be aware that failure to complete the courses required for admission may limit later enrollment in certain majors, particularly those involving mathematics.

<p>
CSUMB may provisionally admit first&#45;time freshman applicants based on their academic preparation through the junior year of high school and planned coursework for the senior year. The campus will monitor the final terms of study to ensure that admitted students complete their secondary school studies satisfactorily, including the required college preparatory subjects, and graduate from high school.

</p>

<p>
Students are required to submit an official transcript after graduation to certify that all course work has been satisfactorily completed. Official high school transcripts must be received prior to the deadline set by the University. In no case may documentation of high school graduation be received any later than the census date for a student's first term of CSU enrollment.

</p>

<p>
The campus may rescind admission decisions, cancel financial aid awards, withdraw housing contracts, and cancel any University registration for students who are found to be ineligible after the final transcript has been evaluated.

</p>

<p>
Applicants will qualify for regular &#40;non&#45;provisional&#41; admission when the University verifies that you have graduated and received a diploma from high school, have a qualifiable minimum eligibility index, have completed the comprehensive pattern of college preparatory A&#45;G subjects, and, if applying to an impacted program or campus, have met all supplementary criteria.

</p>

<p>
The CSU uses only the ACT composite score or the mathematics and critical reading scores on the old SAT, or mathematics and Evidence&#45;Based Reading and Writing scores on the new SAT in its admission eligibility equation.  The SAT or ACT writing scores are not currently used by CSU campuses.

<p>
The California Promise Program enables a specific number of campuses of the California State University &#40;CSU&#41; to establish pledge programs for entering first&#45;time students who are both interested and able to complete baccalaureate degrees in 4&#45;years. All campuses have established programs for students with Associate Degrees for Transfer from any California Community College to complete their baccalaureate degrees in 2&#45;years. The program is limited to students who are residents of California.

</p>

<p>
Students who commit to enter either the 4&#45;year or 2&#45;year pledge will be given a priority registration appointment for each state&#45;supported enrollment period and will be provided with routine and thorough academic advisement. In order to remain in the program, students must meet with their advisors as prescribed, develop an enrollment plan, and complete 30 semester units of quarter equivalent within each academic year,including summer. Participating campuses may stipulate other important requirements as well. Interested students entering the CSU in the fall 2017 term should contact the campus offices or visit <a href="http://www.calstate.edu/sas/california-promise">www.calstate.edu/sas/california-promise</a>.

<p>
Most commonly, college level credits earned from an institution of higher education accredited by a regional accrediting agency is accepted for transfer to campuses of the CSU; however, authority for decisions regarding the transfer of undergraduate credits is delegated to each CSU campus.

</p>

<p>
California Community Colleges and other authorized certifying institutions can certify up to 39 semester &#40;58.5 quarter&#41; units of General Education&#45;Breadth &#40;GE&#45;Breadth&#41; or 37 semester &#40;55.5 quarter&#41; units of the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum &#40;IGETC&#41; for transfer students to fulfill lower&#45;division general education requirements for any CSU campus prior to transfer.

</p>

<p>
"Certification" is the official notification from a California Community College or authorized institution that a transfer student has completed courses fulfilling lower&#45;division general education requirements. The CSU GE&#45;Breadth and the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum &#40;IGETC&#41; certification course lists for particular community colleges can be accessed at <a href="http://www.assist.org/web&#45;assist/welcome.html">www.assist.org</a>.

<p>
CSU campuses may enter into course&#45;to&#45;course or program&#45;to&#45;program articulation agreements with other CSU campuses and any or all of the California community colleges, and other regionally accredited institutions. Established CSU and CCC articulations may be found on <a href="http://www.assist.org/web&#45;assist/welcome.html">www.assist.org</a>. Students may be permitted to transfer no more than 70 semester &#40;105 quarter&#41; units to a CSU campus from an institution which does not offer bachelor’s degrees or their equivalents, for example, community colleges. Given the university’s 30&#45;semester &#40;45&#45;quarter&#41; unit residency requirement, no more than a total of 90&#45;semester &#40;135&#45;quarter&#41; units may be transferred into the university from all sources.

CSUMB uses <em>articulation</em> as a general term referring to written agreements between CSUMB and other institutions within the California Community College &#40;CCC&#41;, University of California &#40;UC&#41;, and California State University &#40;CSU&#41; systems, as well as various accredited independent colleges and universities. This general term is also often used in reference to the preparation to enter a CSUMB major.

</p>

<p>
Lower&#45;division course&#45;to&#45;course articulation is a formal, written, faculty&#45;approved agreement that identifies courses &#40;or sequences of courses&#41; taught at other institutions that are equivalent to, or acceptable in lieu of, specific courses/outcomes/requirements at CSUMB.

</p>

<p>
Course&#45;to&#45;course articulation agreements are developed for the transfer of coursework toward general transfer to CSUMB, transfer to CSUMB at the upper&#45;division level, and transfer to CSUMB which includes meeting some of the lower&#45;division requirements of an academic major at CSUMB. These articulation agreements spell out how specific courses completed at another institution match up with specific courses taught at CSUMB, satisfy specific University Learning Requirements &#40;ULRs&#41;, or meet specific Major Learning Outcomes &#40;MLOs&#41;.

</p>

<p>
Course&#45;to&#45;course articulation agreements for primary institutions are located on the <a href="http://csumb.edu/articulation">CSUMB.EDU/articulation</a> webpage.

<p>
Major preparation and articulated courses from all California community colleges are listed on <a href="http://assist.org/">assist.org</a>. It is strongly recommended that you review this information with the assistance of the academic advising counselors assigned to you at your primary institution.

</p>

<p>
CSUMB Articulation oversees the articulation and major preparation process described above. This office ensures that appropriate CSUMB academic program faculty members review all requests from other postsecondary institutions for course&#45;to&#45;course articulation, that they approve all agreements, and that they sign off on all major preparation formats which CSUMB offers as the means by which you can enter a CSUMB major as a transfer student.

The Lower&#45;Division Transfer Pattern &#40;LDTP&#41; project, sponsored by the California State University &#40;CSU&#41; and supported by the California Community Colleges, presents potential transfer students with the most direct path to a bachelor's degree in the CSU system. The LDTP project provides a set of "road maps" for students to follow that will ensure appropriate academic preparation and that will decrease time to graduation once LDTP students enter the CSU. <strong>Students may enter into an LDTP agreement up to the time they have completed 45 transferable units.</strong> Students who elect to follow the LDTP option will receive the highest priority for admission to a CSU campus.

</p>

<p>
"Highest priority for admission" is defined as a written guarantee of admission to a particular CSU campus and major, and it goes into effect when both the student and the CSU campus ratify an LDTP agreement. The guarantee is subject both to satisfactory completion of the agreement requirements and to the campus's ability to accommodate the student. Students will be asked to complete successfully a specified set of general education courses and major courses that will be common to all CSU campuses offering that major, and they will be asked to complete successfully an additional set of courses identified by the particular CSU campus named in the LDTP agreement. <strong>The coursework in the systemwide and campus&#45;specific LDTP pattern will total at least 60 units, the number needed to transfer to CSU as an upper&#45;division student.</strong> Through Cal State Apply and ASSIST, students and counselors will be able to find road maps detailing coursework preparation by CSU campus and major.

The CSU requires that each entering undergraduate, except those who qualify for an exemption, take the CSU Entry Level Mathematics &#40;ELM&#41; examination and the CSU English Placement Test &#40;EPT&#41; prior to enrollment. These placement tests are not a condition for admission to the CSU, but they are a condition of enrollment. These examinations are designed to identify entering students who may need additional support in acquiring college entry&#45;level English and mathematics skills necessary to succeed in CSU baccalaureate&#45;level courses.

</p>

<p>
If you do not demonstrate college&#45;level skills both in English and in mathematics, you will be placed in appropriate remedial programs and activities during the first term of your enrollment. If placed in remedial programs in either English or mathematics, you must complete all remediation in your <em><strong>first year</strong></em> of enrollment. Failure to complete remediation by the end of your first year may result in denial of enrollment for future terms.

</p>

<p>
Students register for the EPT &#40;<a href="http://www.csuenglishsuccess.org/ept">www.csuenglishsuccess.org/ept</a>&#41; and/or ELM <a href="http://www.csumathsuccess.org/elm_exam">&#40;http://www.csumathsuccess.org/elm_exam</a>&#41;.  Campus may establish deadlines by which new students must register for and/or take placement exams as a requirement for enrollment.

Graduate and post&#45;baccalaureate applicants may apply for a degree objective,  a credential or certificate objective, or where approved, may have no program objective. Depending on the objective, the CSU will consider an application for admission as follows.

</p>

<p>
General Requirements &#45; The minimum requirements for admission to graduate and post&#45;baccalaureate studies at a California State University campus are in accordance with university regulations as well as Title 5, Chapter 1, Subchapter 3 of the California Code of Regulations. Specifically, a student shall, at the time of enrollment:

</p>

<ul>
      <li>
        Have completed a four&#45;year college course of study and hold an acceptable baccalaureate degree from an institution accredited by a regional accrediting association, or shall have completed equivalent academic preparation as determined by appropriate campus authorities;
      </li>
      <li>
        Be in good academic standing at the last college or university attended;
      </li>
      <li>
        Have earned a grade point average of at least 2.5 in the last 60 semester &#40;90 quarter&#41; units attempted; and
      </li>
      <li>
        Satisfactorily met the professional, personal, scholastic, and other standards for graduate study, including qualifying examinations, as appropriate campus authorities may prescribe. In unusual circumstances, a campus may make exceptions to these criteria.
      </li>
</ul>

<p>
If you meet the minimum requirements for graduate and post&#45;baccalaureate studies, you may be considered for admission in one of the four following categories:

</p>

<p>
<strong>Graduate Classified</strong> – To pursue a graduate degree, applicants are required to fulfill all of the professional, personal, scholastic, and other standards, including qualifying examinations, prescribed by the campus; or

</p>

<p>
<strong>Graduate Conditionally Classified</strong> – Applicants may be admitted to a graduate degree program in this category if, in the opinion of appropriate campus authority, deficiencies maybe remedied by additional preparation; or

</p>

<p>
<strong>Post&#45;Baccalaureate Classified, e.g. admission to an education credential program</strong> – Persons wishing to enroll in a credential or certificate program, will be required to satisfy additional professional, personal,scholastic, and other standards, including qualifying examinations, prescribed by the campus; or

</p>

<p>
<strong>Post&#45;Baccalaureate Unclassified</strong> – To enroll in undergraduate courses as preparation for advanced degree programs or to enroll in graduate courses for professional or personal growth, applicants must be admitted as post&#45;baccalaureate unclassified students. By meeting the general requirements, applicants are eligible for admission as post&#45;baccalaureate unclassified students. Admission in this status does not constitute admission to, or assurance of consideration for admission to, any graduate degree or credential program. &#40;Most CSU campuses do not offer admission to unclassified post&#45;baccalaureate students&#41;.

</p>

<p>
&#40;These and other CSU admission requirements are subject to change as policies are revised and laws are amended.

If still enrolled in high school, you will be considered for enrollment in certain special programs if recommended by the principal and the appropriate campus department chair and if preparation is equivalent to that required of eligible California high school graduates. Such admission is only for a given specific program and does not constitute the right to continued enrollment. For participating programs, contact CSUMB Office of Admissions.

</p>

<p>
High school students other than those accepted into the above programs may also enroll concurrently in college courses without fee reduction upon approval of parents, high school principal, appropriate CSUMB program directors, and Office of Admissions.

<p>
As an alternative to regular admission criteria, an applicant who is 25 years of age or older may be considered for admission as an adult student if he or she meets all of the following conditions:

</p>

<ul>
      <li>
        Possesses a high school diploma &#40;or has established equivalence through either the General Educational Development or California High School Proficiency examinations&#41;.
      </li>
      <li>
        Has not been enrolled in college as a full&#45;time student for more than one term during the past five years.
      </li>
      <li>
        If there has been any college attendance in the last five years, has earned a C average or better in all college work attempted.
      </li>
</ul>

<p>
Consideration will be based upon a judgment as to whether the applicant is as likely to succeed as a regularly admitted freshman or transfer student and will include an assessment of basic skills in the English language and mathematical computation.
