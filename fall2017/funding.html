<p>
The total support cost per full&#45;time equivalent student &#40;FTES&#41; includes the expenditures for current operations, including payments made to students in the form of financial aid, and all fully reimbursed programs contained in state appropriations. The average support cost is determined by dividing the total cost by the number of FTES. The total CSU 2016/17 budget amounts were $3,169,425,000 from state General Fund &#40;GF&#41; appropriations and before adding $36.8 million CalPERS retirement adjustment, $1,685,885,000 from tuition fee revenue and after tuition fee discounts &#40;forgone revenue&#41;, and $528,555,000 from other fee revenues for a total of $5,383,865,000. The 2016/17 resident FTES target is 361,644  and the non&#45;resident FTES based on past&#45;year actual is 22,552 for a total of 384,196 FTES. The GF appropriation is applicable to resident students only whereas fee revenues are collected from resident and nonresident students. FTES is determined by dividing the total academic student load &#40;e.g., 15 units per semester&#41; &#40;the figure used here to define a full&#45;time studentâ€™s academic load&#41;.

</p>

<p>
The 2016/17 average support cost per FTES based on GF appropriation and net tuition fee revenue only is $13,152 and when including all sources as indicated below is $14,528, which includes all fee revenue &#40;e.g., tuition fees, application fees, and other campus mandatory fees&#41; in the CSU Operating Fund. Of this amount, the average net tuition and other fee revenue per FTES is $5,764.
