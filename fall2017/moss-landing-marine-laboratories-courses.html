    </h3>
    <p>
      MLML 274: Adv Topics-  This course will focus on the interactions between geological and biological processes in marine and coastal environments of the Gulf of California.  The emphasis is on modern and past earth processes and their relationship to the ecology and sedimentology of coastal-nearshore systems including  shallow water rhodolith beds, mangroves, estuaries and beaches.  Lectures, readings, intensive field work, and composing a scientific paper based on original research.  Students must be able to participate in 2 weeks of field work and a valid passport is required.

    </h3>
    <p>
      MLML 285:Grad Sem Mar Bio-  This seminar is a multidisciplinary approach to climate changes and the study of the interactions between the hydrosphere, atmosphere, biosphere, cryosphere and lithosphere in marine sciences. Earth's climate has abruptly changed and changed the environment many times in the geologic past. The record of past climate variations is the key to understand modern changes and to predicted future climate variations and their effects on life on our planet. Students will present and discuss peer-reviewed articles on different topics concerning the complexity of the Earth systems and their interactions at different time scales and will discuss society's understanding or our modern climate state through discussion of the 2013 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report and various literature surrounding it.Offered through Moss Landing Marine Laboratories (MLML); contact SEP program office for MLML registration procedures.
