The Service Learning Leadership Minor helps you develop advanced knowledge and skills in service learning leadership, preparing you to work as a leader in the growing field of service learning. As this field grows, so does the need for well trained service learning professionals, capable of creating and implementing partnership programs between educational institutions and communities. After completing this minor, you will be able to take a position as a leader in the field of service learning and community service, both locally and at the state and national levels.

</p>

<p>
This Minor combines a focus on experiential learning with a grounding in theories of service and social justice. It gives you a strong foundation in the design and delivery of service learning experiences, understanding of community and social change processes, and perspectives in service and social justice. In addition, you integrate this knowledge in the form of a Senior Capstone service learning project, designed and carried out collaboratively with a community organization.
