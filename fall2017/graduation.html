<p>
All baccalaureate and graduate degree seeking students must apply for graduation during the filing period for the term in which all degree requirements will be completed.

</p>

<p>
A graduation application/diploma fee is due at the time that you submit your application. Late applications submitted after the final application deadline will be reviewed at the <strong>end</strong> of the graduation term during final degree verification processing.

</p>

<p>
The application process should begin with a meeting with your faculty or undergraduate academic advisor to review your online degree audit information. If you are completing alternate approved courses &#40;substitutions&#41; to clear major/minor requirements, online substitution authorizations should be submitted by the appropriate faculty advisor. Applications are reviewed by a graduation counselor in date received order and students will be notified by campus email when their online academic requirements report has been updated.  Again, students who file graduation applications <strong>after</strong> the posted application deadline will have their records reviewed at the <strong>end</strong> of the graduation term.

</p>

<p>
If you are a <strong>master's degree candidate</strong>, you must also have your Advancement to Candidacy form on file in the Office of the Registrar prior to the term in which you will apply to graduate.

</p>

<p>
An explanation of the official graduation application process and filing deadlines/fees can be found on the <a href="https://csumb.edu/planning">Classes &amp; Planning webpage</a> under the heading: <a href="https://csumb.edu/planning#apply&#45;graduate">Apply to Graduate</a>.
