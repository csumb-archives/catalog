        FYS  143: Philosophy of Nonviolence
      </a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      The purpose of this class is twofold: 1) to introduce students to the academic model used at CSUMB, and, 2) to introduce students to the theory, philosophy, and practice of nonviolence and how that strategy has brought about significant cultural change from South Africa in the early 20th century to Egypt in the 21st Century.  Through an examination of the Core Values, Vision Statement, Academic Goals, Major Fields, and potential career pathways, students create an academic plan for the first two years of study. Students also learn about the philosophy, principles, and methods of nonviolence to see how that practice has brought about social change for millions of persecuted, oppressed, and marginalized people in various cultural and global settings throughout the world.

      This section of First Year Seminar uses the cultural and technical framework of digital media (like manga, anime, video games and digital animation) to reference the core concepts of life as a new university student.

In sum, we explore just how past cultural practices differ from or align with contemporary approaches to sustainability?  And ask, what does archaeology reveal about the successes, limitations, and failures of past human efforts to generate sustainable practices?
