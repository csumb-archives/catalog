CSU Monterey Bay is a recognized national leader in the field of service learning. CSUMB is unique in higher education, having made service learning a required element of the academic program. Students learn about community involvement and social change through required service learning courses in both their lower division general education program and in their major. <strong>Each academic year, 50 percent of CSUMB students enroll in service learning courses,</strong> contributing thousands of hours of work to over 200 schools, non&#45;profit organizations and government agencies in the region.

</p>

<p>
CSUMB's outcomes&#45;based academic program, and its campus&#45;wide commitment to issues of diversity and social justice, further distinguish CSUMB's service learning program. Through service learning, all CSUMB students work to develop the knowledge, skills and attitudes to participate sensitively in multicultural communities, and to work effectively to address deep&#45;seated social inequities. The goal is to help CSUMB students become <strong><em>multicultural community builders: students who are able to work sensitively and effectively in a diverse society to create more just and equitable workplaces, communities and social institutions.</em></strong>

</p>

<p>
CSUMB has received significant national and international recognition for its leadership in the field of service learning and civic engagement. CSUMB is <strong>the only two&#45;time &#40;in 2006 and 2010&#41; winner</strong> of the prestigious <em>White House President's Award for Excellence in Higher Education Community Service.</em> CSUMB was one of three President's Award recipients in the inaugural year of 2006, when over 500 universities applied. In 2010, CSUMB was one of six President's Award winners, out of over 800 applicants. In addition, CSUMB has consistently been recognized for excellence in service learning by US News &amp; World Report.

<p>
The Service Learning Institute is the home of CSUMB's award&#45;winning service learning program: <a href="https://csumb.edu/service">CSUMB.EDU/service</a>. In addition to supporting service learning campus&#45;wide, the Service Learning Institute offers courses that meet both the Lower Division &#40;D3&#41; and Upper Division &#40;D4&#41; service learning requirement. Students who develop a strong interest in service learning are able to graduate with a <a href="https://csumb.edu/catalog/service&#45;learning&#45;leadership&#45;minor">Minor in Service Learning Leadership</a>.

<p>
In service learning courses, the community <strong>is</strong> your classroom. Each semester CSUMB students are actively engaged in schools and community&#45;based organizations.

</p>

<p>
Faculty members work with community organizations to find the appropriate fit between course learning outcomes and the needs and resources of each organization. Instructors provide you with a list of sites from which to choose, and they may even arrange class visits or field trips to the sites to guide you toward finding an organization that will appreciate your talents and skills.

CSUMB's service learning requirement has two components: the <a href="http://csumb.edu/node/20517/area&#45;d#d3&#45;lower&#45;division&#45;service&#45;learning">Lower Division Service Learning Requirement</a>; and the <a href="http://csumb.edu/node/20517/area&#45;d#d4&#45;upper&#45;division&#45;service&#45;learning">Upper Division Service Learning Requirement</a>.  All service learning courses are designated in the catalog by the "S" suffix &#40;i.e., <a href="/courses/json/bio-379s.json" class="course-link">BIO  379S: Biology Service Learning <span class="course-units">(5 units)</span></a>; <a href="/courses/json/hcom-350s.json" class="course-link">HCOM  350S: Oral Hist/Comm Mem SL <span class="course-units">(6 units)</span></a>&#41;. If a course has an "S" designation, it will:

</p>

<ul>
      <li>
        Involve students in service activities or projects with <strong>external communities</strong> that are r<strong>esponsive to community&#45;identified needs</strong>;
      </li>
      <li>
        Require students to <strong>integrate the learning</strong> derived from service with course learning outcomes <strong>through critical reflection</strong> exercises, discussion, written, oral or media presentations; and,
      </li>
      <li>
        Provide students an opportunity for consistent engagement in the community for a minimum of <strong>30 hours</strong> over the duration of the semester, <strong>focused on the Lower or Upper Division Service Learning Outcomes</strong>.
