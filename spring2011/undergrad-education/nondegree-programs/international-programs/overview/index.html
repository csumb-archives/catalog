    <span class="print-link"></span> <p>The CSUMB Office of International Programs offers a variety of programs, for students interested in studying overseas or participating in an exchange program within the United States. Some domestic and international programs last for an entire academic year. Others range from just a few weeks to a semester. Whatever your academic program or personal interests, the Office of International Programs undoubtedly offers a program right for you.</p>
<p>A few good reasons to study abroad:</p>
<ul>
<li>To enhance your education. A study abroad or exchange experience adds a new perspective to your studies. You will see things from another point of view, which will help you develop your analytical and critical-thinking skills.</li>
<li>To progress toward graduation. Most domestic or overseas opportunities allow you transfer the credits you take overseas to CSUMB, helping to move you closer to your goal of graduating.</li>
<li>To build your resume. Study in another country or region of the country adds a new dimension to your career planning. In an age of global economies and information super-highways, experience abroad or outside California distinguishes your background from the rest.</li>
<li>To develop your self-awareness. We sometimes impose limitations on ourselves that hinder progress toward our goals. By leaving the familiar behind and encountering different people and places you will gain a better understanding of yourself and the world around you.</li>
<li>To understand another culture. Living and learning in another culture in the midst of the unfamiliar adds to your understanding of the variety of cultures in our world and can give you a maturity and perspective that can be gained in no other way.</li>
</ul>
