<p>The California State University is committed to providing equal opportunities to male and female CSU students in all campus programs, including intercollegiate athletics.</p>
<p>CSU Monterey Bay is committed to providing an environment free of discrimination and/or unlawful harassment, including sexual harassment and sexual assault. Discrimination and harassment interfere with educational performance and work, and create an atmosphere of intimidation, low morale and hostility that the university will not tolerate. Students, staff, faculty and administrators are regularly informed of the university&apos;s policy regarding discrimination and sexual harassment and available complaint procedures. In addition, all supervisors are routinely informed of their responsibility regarding complaints made against those whom they supervise.</p>
<p>CSU Monterey Bay maintains an environment free of unlawful discrimination in any of the University&apos;s programs or activities of education and employment. Accordingly, discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex (including sexual harassment and sexual assault), sexual orientation, marital status, pregnancy, age, disability, medical condition and covered veteran status is prohibited. This policy is conducted in accordance with Title VI and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972, Sections 503 and 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Vietnam Era Veteran&apos;s Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990, the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, California State University (CSU) Executive Orders 883 and 927, and appropriate Collective Bargaining Agreements (CBA).</p>
<p>Equal employment and educational opportunity are observed in the administration, housing, and education of students; in policies governing programs and extracurricular activities; and in the employment of faculty, staff and students. The university is committed to increasing the diversity of its faculty, staff, administrators, and students to mirror the increasing diversity of the State of California.</p>
<p>Complaints of discrimination and/or unlawful harassment will be investigated promptly and thoroughly. The university recognizes that under certain circumstances, it has an independent duty to ascertain where discrimination and/or unlawful harassment exist irrespective of whether a complaint is actually filed (for example, complaints of sexual harassment involving physical contact, recurrent or systematic patterns of discrimination, and/or sexual assault involving a university employee or student). The university will act vigorously to prevent any retaliation being taken against individuals filing a complaint, and/or participating in a complaint investigation.</p>
