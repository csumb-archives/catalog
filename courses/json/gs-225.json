Many of the films and readings present the perspectives of those who are caught in the challenging world of \"global flows and disjunctures\", where people, ideas, money, and technologies move quickly around the world, but in unequal and random ways that cause poverty, violence, and social dysfunction/breakdown.  Somewhere in between are stories of those who have learned how to negotiate globalization, appropriating its forces in modes of resistance that force a rethinking of its structures and ethics.  In reacting to and analyzing various expressions of their global peers, and the decisions that confront them, students will address Ethics ULR requirements by examining the ethics of globalization and \"global citizenship.\"  Students will also engage in a robust writing and oral presentation experience as they fulfill the Engcom B ULR requirements.","units_minimum":"4","units_maximum":"4","crse_offer_nbr":"1","term":"2112","crse_attr_list":"CSLI=N, ULR=UEC2, ULR=UETH"}}
