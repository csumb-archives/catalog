Students isolate DNA from marine organisms, amplify specific regions, subclone, and purify plasmid DNA.  Bioinformatic techniques are used to analyze sequenced regions, including homology searches, multiple alignments, primer design, and 3D comparison. Assessment consists of a lab notebook review, a final exam, and a detailed standards-based lesson plan.
