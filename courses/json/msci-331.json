Emphasis will be placed on how organisms are adapted to optimize physiological function under a variety of environmental conditions. We will also focus on the effects of environmental change on marine organismal physiology in the context of climate change (global warming, acidification, hypoxia).\r\n\r\n[Prereq: (BIO 210 and BIO 211 and MSCI 270) and (PHYS 150 or PHYS 220 or PHYS 221)]","units_minimum":"4","units_maximum":"4","crse_offer_nbr":"1","term":"2171","crse_attr_list":"CSLI=N"}}
