Through an examination of the Core Values, Vision Statement, Academic Goals, Major Fields, and potential career pathways, students create an academic plan for the first two years of study. Students also learn about the philosophy, principles, and methods of nonviolence to see how that practice has brought about social change for millions of persecuted, oppressed, and marginalized people in various cultural and global settings throughout the world.\n\n(Freshman Standing)","units_minimum":"4","units_maximum":"4","crse_offer_nbr":"1","term":"2164"}}
