Earth's climate has abruptly changed and changed the environment many times in the geologic past. The record of past climate variations is the key to understand modern changes and to predicted future climate variations and their effects on life on our planet. Students will present and discuss peer-reviewed articles on different topics concerning the complexity of the Earth systems and their interactions at different time scales and will discuss society's understanding or our modern climate state through discussion of the 2013 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report and various literature surrounding it.Offered through Moss Landing Marine Laboratories (MLML); contact SEP program office for MLML registration procedures.\n\n[Prereq: (MLML 504 and MLML 503 and MLML 512) and (Exclude Freshmen and Sophomore and Junior)]","units_minimum":"2","units_maximum":"2","crse_offer_nbr":"1","term":"2164"}}
