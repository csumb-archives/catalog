    <span class="print-link"></span> <p>In order to maintain financial aid eligibility, you must make <em>Satisfactory Academic Progress</em> (SAP) toward obtaining a degree. Satisfactory Academic Progress will be monitored for all periods of enrollment whether or not you have received financial aid. The minimum requirements are that you maintain a 2.0 GPA, meet the unit completion requirements for your enrollment status, and not exceed the maximum time frame for your program. Failure to do so will result in a loss of eligibility for future financial aid. <span>SAP requirements must be completed 30 days after the start of term. Actual deadlines will be published on the Financial Aid Website.</span></p>
<h2><span><span>Minimum Standard Requirements
<p></p></span></span></h2>
<h5>Qualitative Measure (Cumulative GPA)</h5>
<p>You must maintain a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 (equivalent to C average).</p>
<p>Passing grades are A, B, C, D, and CR. Grades of F, I, W, NC, SP, RD, UW, and AU are not passing and will place you in a credit-shortage status.</p>
<h5>Quantitative Measure (Credit Hour Progression)</h5>
<p>You must complete at least 67 percent of credit hours attempted each semester to remain on track. Credit hour progression will be based on a cumulative total of attempted hours to earned hours. For example, a full-time undergraduate student who attempts 24 credits in an academic year must complete at least 16 credits.</p>
<h5>Maximum Timeframe to Complete a Degree</h5>
<p>The maximum allowable timeframe for receiving aid is equal to 150 percent of the length of your academic program. For example, if you are pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration, which requires 127 credits for completion, your maximum timeframe will be 191 credits attempted.</p>
<p>If you are a transfer student, your accepted transfer coursework will be counted in the maximum timeframe. You can repeat a course, but the credits will be applied toward the maximum timeframe.</p>
<p>Required remedial coursework will not be counted toward your maximum timeframe (up to 30 credits).</p>
<h6>Undergraduate Enrollment Status</h6>
<ul>
<li>Fulltime ~ 12 or more undergraduate credits</li>
<li>Three-quarter time ~ 9 to 11 undergraduate credits </li>
<li>Half time ~ 6 to 8 undergraduate credits</li>

</ul>

<h5>Financial Aid Probation</h5>
<p>Students who have not met the Minimum Standard Requirements will be placed on <strong>probation</strong>. You are still eligible for Financial Aid consideration while on probation. Students who do not meet Minimum Standard Requirements at the end of their probationary semester, will be placed on <strong>suspension</strong> for the next term. Students who are on probation will be required to attend a Satisfactory Academic Progress Workshop before funds are released for the following semester.</p>
<h5>Financial Aid Suspension</h5>
<p>If the financial aid office determines that you have not met the Minimum Standard Requirements to receive Financial Aid, you will be disqualified from Financial Aid assistance. You are not eligible for Financial Aid consideration while on suspension. Students who are on suspension will be required to attend a Satisfactory Academic Progress Workshop before funds are released for the following semester.</p>
<h5>Reinstatement</h5>
<p>If you maintain satisfactory academic progress without financial aid for one academic year (completing at least 12 credits total), you may be eligible for reinstatement and regain eligibility for financial aid. You must notify the financial aid office in writing when you have completed the reinstatement requirements. Students who have been disqualified for exceeding the maximum time frame are ineligible for reinstatement and can only regain financial aid eligibility through the appeal process. Students who are reinstated will be required to attend a Satisfactory Academic Progress Workshop before funds are released for the following semester.</p>
<h5>Appeal Process</h5>
<p>You have the right to appeal your suspension from financial aid. The appeal form is available on the <a href="http://financialaid.csumb.edu" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Financial Aid website</a>. You should provide an explanation of any extenuating circumstances that prevented you from maintaining satisfactory academic progress. Supporting documentation will strengthen your appeal. The appeal will be reviewed by a financial aid counselor. You will be notified of the result of your appeal by email or letter. If your appeal is denied, you may request an additional review by the financial aid appeals committee. The appeals committee&apos;s decision is final.</p>
