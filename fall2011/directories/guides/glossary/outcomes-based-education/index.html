    <span class="print-link"></span> <p>An educational model where the educators first identify the desired  end results, then identify and develop the means to achieve those  results. This means that faculty members publicly articulate learning  outcomes and assessment criteria in advance of instruction. They also  focus curriculum and instruction on the agreed-upon student learning  outcomes. Student progress and completion of courses and programs of  study are determined by proficiency in the articulated outcomes.</p>
<p>Grounding curriculum and instruction on an outcomes-based education  model has the power to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Focus resources and instruction on common and cohesive student  learning goals.</li>
<li>Institutionalize core academic values across the academic program.</li>
<li>Foster continuous attention on student learning.</li>
<li>Enhance institutional accountability.</li>
</ul>
<p>Outside of the educational world, outcomes-based is the norm. <em>Example:</em> You first decide that you want to get to the store, then you determine  whether you should walk, drive, or take the bus. Few just jump on the  bus then later decide to have the ride result in getting off at the  store. Overall, individuals make few decisions in life without some  desired outcome in mind. While the action-first approach can result in  great discovery and surprises, it hardly seems efficient for people who  want to move forward in life. Unfortunately, education has often focused  on specific actions that produce varied results, rather than specific  results that can be reached through various actions. Most notably, most  colleges require students to take specific courses as part of their  program of study, but no one ensures that various sections of those  courses taught by different professors result in students learning the  same things. Passing the courses becomes the objective. CSUMB identifies  the desired learning outcomes first, then adopts courses that will  produce those outcomes. The university also provides mechanisms for  getting appropriate credit if students have already achieved designated  outcomes through prior learning experiences rather than requiring that  they take specific courses.</p>
